# [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

I use the app to manage events in my life I sync with Google Calendar.

I always view my events from `Week` view & have 7 days in view with 18 hours shown in one view. This gives perspective over current and upcoming events/deadlines. All events created by default have 30 min duration.

I often switch between `Week` and `Month` views.

[Cron](https://cron.com/) & [Amie](https://www.amie.so/) are nice too.

## Notes

- To mass delete events, make empty search query (single space) on events I want to remove and delete them. Can also use stock Calendar app and search for `""` and cmd+shift+arrows events I want to delete.
- [Google calendar sync select page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect) allows you to select which calendars you want to sync to external apps like Fantastical. Useful for letting Fantastical know about `Other calendars` which by default don't sync.
- Pressing `return` when clicking on event will let you edit the title of it.
