# [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/)

Love 2Do as it taught me what a proper task manager should look like.

I now use [KusKus](https://kuskus.app) as my main task manager. 

When I did use 2Do, I did it like so:

Here is how my sidebar looked like:

It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

I used 2Do only for personal tasks. Team & project tasks are done on [GitHub](../../open-source/github/index.md).

## Managing tasks with tags

My main way of managing tasks is with **tags**. This lets me give scope to the task I want to complete and lets me filter through the many thousands of tasks I have in my **Inbox**.

I create many smart lists of most common tags I want to jump to. I use `j` key and macros that activate the URL scheme to jump between the lists.

I made my `All` list sorted by `Modified date`. This lets me cleanly delete or act on all tasks that have been sitting in my 2Do for too long with no activity.

I have [2Do setup to schedule a weekly Sunday review & plan task](../../focusing/index.md).

## URL Scheme

[2Do URL schemes documentation](https://www.2doapp.com/kb/article/url-schemes.html) has everything. I use these URL schemes currently:

- Go to 2Do list from URL scheme: `twodo://x-callback-url/showList?name=PR` (would go to to **PR** list).

## 2Do tasks shared

I once used 2Do as replacement for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) for links to read/watch/check later.

I share a snapshot of [these tasks](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/c8b71bfb06634877bbcf94ef2fc0c95f).
