## Apps I used but dropped

#### [Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)

> iOS like mouse text selection popover

Brings up a quick menu whenever some text is selected on which I can do a number of quick actions, like searching selected text on Google, YouTube or copy the text. Here are the extensions I have activated:

How it looked for me

Everything I use comes by default with PopClip except YouTube extension which you can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gckplsy5d4mg4rq/AABgvWT9QKg0NlwC9Bz8X9B0a?dl=0). I used [PopMaker](http://brettterpstra.com/2014/05/12/popmaker-popclip-extension-generator/) tool to create this web search extension.

#### [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/)

> RSS Reeder

The app I once used to keep up with my RSS feeds. I use RSS to follow my favorite blogs, stay up to date on new podcast episodes and even track some software releases.
I used [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to sync [blogs I follow](../../research/blogs.md) between phone and mac. Here is how it looked like for me:

## Notes

- [macOS Preview app has a built-in feature to remove image background](https://twitter.com/poorlybatched/status/1608339437754421250)
- `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ChatGPT.app` = would make it so you can open 'damaged' apps. Replace `ChatGPT` with app you have.
