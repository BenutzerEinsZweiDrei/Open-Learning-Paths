# Transportation

[Flexport](https://www.flexport.com/) is a great logistics company.

Personally would love to own electric [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/) one day, probably [Taycan 4S](https://www.porsche.com/international/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-4s/). They make truly [gorgeous cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmzn77xOCe0). [Carrera S](https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/ob8jjs/992_carrera_s/) or [992 GT3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5x-__kvGY) are pretty too. But not electric and it's silly to buy combustion cars at this point.

I wish there were more electric superchargers in EU. Tesla cars seem nice too. Curious when [autonomy](../../machine-learning/autonomous-driving.md) will be solved.
