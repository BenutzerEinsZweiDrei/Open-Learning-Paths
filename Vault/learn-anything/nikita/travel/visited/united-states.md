# United States

Would love to visit or maybe live in US one day but [they don't make it easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uksw7zrFr4A) due to [odd political choices](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1520132242672029696). [Their loss](https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1605722098239885312).

Sadly many great companies still only hire if you're physically present in US. Including some top tier companies in computers and space industries.

Thankfully this is changing as more companies wake up and realize the world is bigger than US and you can build successful companies that embrace the benefits of whole company being [remote and async communication first](../../work/remote-work.md).

It's sad really as US could be a great country if they didn't close themselves off from the world. The fact that with US passport you are [taxed globally no matter what country you stay in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSJEwxV2QQ8) is not enticing either.

For now I am personally interested in [building global companies](../../business/startups/index.md) whilst living in cities with [great public infrastructure](../cities.md), [great food](../../health/nutrition/foods.md) and weather. [Portugal](portugal.md) and many [EU](europe.md) countries are great for this.

I try to avoid pointless politics news as much as possible but do like [John Mearsheimer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=John+Mearsheimer) & [George Friedman](https://twitter.com/george_friedman)'s analysis in regards to US foreign policy.

[Ask Americans](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/) is fun subreddit. Liked [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR5TWIPkMks) on issues US has regarding housing/health care policies amongst other things.

## Notes

- [Quality of food in most of US is not great. Easy to gain weight due to portion size and added sugar.](https://twitter.com/bigmagicdao/status/1583729984304164864)
- [Most cost-effective way (aka costs nothing) to get to work in the US is to get hired by a multinational Corp and after 1 year get an L visa and move to the US.](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1280953429527900160)
- [US has exit tax when renouncing citizenship if net worth is $2m+ or high federal taxes or not compliant; easier to leave before triggering. If just leaving to live overseas, you still must file and pay USA subject to exclusions, treaties, credits, etc](https://twitter.com/nomadcapitalist/status/1454574254566019080)
- [If the USA had a core KPI, it would be immigration. It has a monopoly on ambitious migrants—if that disappears, the product inevitably fails.](https://twitter.com/cpaik/status/1459534475042435083)
- [Puerto Rico due to Act 60 decree allows you to pay no capital gains for 15 years, while keeping US citizenship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/rj6iju/moving_form_switzerland_to_the_beautiful_united/)
- [Allowing 54 units/acre as-of-right citywide would solve most US cities' housing affordability crisis in a span of like two years.](https://twitter.com/mnolangray/status/1515081757883731971)
- [Average US billionaire effectively pays a 3.4% tax rate while the average worker pays 25%.](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1516078047740502026)
- [One of the things that boggles my mind about living in the US is how deeply individualism permeates every aspect of life. there’s no sense of community or a relational identity, really. It’s just every person onto their own at the end of the day. It’s very sad.](https://twitter.com/most_opppressed/status/1516802246087950338)
- ["Democracy" in America is and has always been "government by capital". The original idea was that private wealth should drive government rather than family nobility. That's why only landowners voted, that's why the 3/5 compromise, etc.](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1521467530098864128)
- [Majority of our food in the US is terrible for you](https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1566172574236565504)
- With [EB-5 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/eb-5-immigrant-investor-program), I can either do either [passive or active investment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orVtSuGpuu8). Active is ~ 1 million US dollars invested in my own startup in US with promise of creating 10 jobs within 2 years after approval of green card.
- [San Francisco, Oakland, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Bodega Bay are nice US visits](https://twitter.com/isosteph/status/1596920968387399681)
- [The way to solve a labour shortage is to let wages rise until they reach a level where people feel like having children is something which causes them no problems. Trying to 'solve' this with immigration is a terrible idea which has led to enormous problems, for example, here in Sweden. Immigration will furthermore increase the labour supply and thus drive down real wages. We've seen time and time again that reductions in labour supply lead to greatly increased real wages, even after very destructive events such as wars and the great plagues, and that an increase in labour supply greatly reduces wages, even when the increases were permitted by large-scale technical innovation and industrial transformation, such as at the opening of the California railroad.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/ztbw5c/america_needs_immigrants_to_solve_its_labor/)
- [Consolidation is definitely a problem across the larger US economy, particularly in finance, telcom, media, and medicine. We've seen a long term trend away from strict anti-trust enforcement to a more permissive standard that asks if the monopoly is causing customer harm. Regulatory capture is a very real problem. The 2008 crash is a clear example of both how things have gone too far, and in how instead of reform we got a taxpayer bailout without restructuring the big banks, which creates an obvious moral hazard.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1027lpw/credibledefense_daily_megathread_january_03_2023/)
