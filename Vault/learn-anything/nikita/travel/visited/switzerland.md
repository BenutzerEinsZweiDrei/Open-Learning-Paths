# Switzerland

## Notes

- [Switzerland is one of the best countries for wealth accumulation phase, salaries are high. But I would not recommend retiring here because the cost of living is very high. Still, taxes are low, there are no capital gains tax and dividends are taxed together with your income. My plan is to accumulate here and retire in Portugal in a few years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeFIRE/comments/z1mcov/best_european_country_for_fire_optimizing_for_low/)
