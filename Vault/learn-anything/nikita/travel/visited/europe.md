# Europe

Love Europe. Specifically how varied the culture can be in such short distances together with beautiful and practical [cities that focus on humans over cars](https://twitter.com/ryanoferguson/status/1521745658855792645).

I am not too fond of how high the tax is for many EU countries though given the benefits you get for this tax money aren't transparent at all. I'd love to be able to dedicate what portion of my tax goes where.

There are [many nice EU countries with lower tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnUa3BZLoSA) though that you can work from.

I am also curious how you can make EU political system more efficient, right now it seems incredibly messy. I am also not sure how to [stop the stagnation of EU financially](https://twitter.com/zebulgar/status/1525201411641856001). I think focusing on removing useless guardrails to do entrepreneurship with better access to local funding will go a long way in accelerating building more value everywhere. It's also quite unfortunate that US and China are the only countries that are focused on building companies in the space industry.

So far I lived in [Netherlands](netherlands.md), [Cyprus](cyprus.md) & [UK](united-kingdom.md).

Currently reside in [Spain](spain.md). Want to spend some time in [Portugal](portugal.md) or [Georgia](georgia.md) soon.

## Notes

- [Czech has low income taxes. Base rate is 15 and 22 % is high rate. But you also add social and health insurance. We also have small business licenses where you can significantly reduce social so no retirement fund but a lot of cash on hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/we1pod/about_7000_to_15000_income_per_month_how_to_invest/)
- [After 3 weeks of living in Europe I would like to admit I was wrong. Cities arent spiritually bankrupt wastelands, I only ever lived in North American ones and did not expect how incredible it is to live in cities that cater to the human experience.](https://twitter.com/lilbabygandhi/status/1573683284416102402)

- [There is a significant division between the Northern and Southern economies. The north have benefited from the Euro with collective purchasing power, while the South got a stable currency. However the Southern economies would benefit from a cheaper currency in so many ways. Germany has resisted true Eurozone bonds which are a logical part of the single currency proposition (the ECB got around it with QE) but sooner or later it needs to happen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/ziluzx/the_fall_of_the_euro/)
