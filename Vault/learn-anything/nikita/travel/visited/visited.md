# Visited

I keep a list of [places I liked visiting](https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/1t_jW3zR93T4wMQCQPo1aBbcS61A) and ones I [want to visit](https://www.google.com/maps/placelists/list/T6SMXQdXBoOPiXTheDQpDiUce_Ffyw).

From places I've been to thus far, I loved visiting Edinburgh the most. Living in Amsterdam and London is amazing. So many things happening all the time.

Given I work [remotely](../../work/remote-work.md) and can choose any place to work from. I try pick cities to stay based off food they have and the community of people living there.

Jumping from country to country without staying there for at least 2-3 months in my eyes can get exhausting quickly. Need to find nice coffee place to work from with good chairs and internet. Need time to explore the place and actually feel the culture. Meet the locals, take photos.
