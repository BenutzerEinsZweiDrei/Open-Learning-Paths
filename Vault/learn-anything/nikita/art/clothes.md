# Clothes

Love Keanus's clothes in [this interview](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a38241136/keanu-reeves-interview-2021/). [Manny Jacinto's too](https://flaunt.com/content/manny-jacinto-the-gift-issue).

In general, I love [Christian Sieber](https://www.instagram.com/christiansieber/)'s style, although maybe a bit more casual than that. [Alex Rivière](https://www.instagram.com/ariviere/)'s style is great too so as her [clothing line's IG photos](https://www.instagram.com/alexrivierestudio/). Also [Casatlantic](https://www.casatlantic.com/) is [great](https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/status/1595696287726243842).

Still exploring different kinds of clothing styles. I currently mostly use [Björn Borg](https://www.bjornborg.com/en/)'s underwear/shirts/trousers/socks/shoes. Love their quality and minimal style.
