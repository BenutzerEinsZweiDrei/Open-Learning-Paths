# Internationalization

Currently using [Inlang](https://github.com/inlang/inlang) for everything.

## Notes

- [Made i18n strictly typed and every time I render a string that is not translated yet - typescript shows an error, so I can't forget it.](https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1456205531153055755)
