title: Inlang Git SDK RFC
---

# Attempt on [Inlang Git RFC](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/pull/455)

Below is my answer to the [Inlang](https://inlang.com)'s Git SDK RFC. Learned a lot about how Git worked trying to write the RFC out.

## Background

This RFC evaluates two architectures on building a git backend that serves current and foreseen needs of inlang.

The inlang editor currently uses the git JS implementation. The JS implementation lacks git features that are required to build out the editor. The lack of git features triggered the exploration of switching the underlying git implementation, see [https://github.com/inlang/inlang/issues/278](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/issues/278).

### Glossary

- **isomorphic git** -The JavaScript git implementation currently used in the inlang editor.
- **libgit2** - The git implementation that can be compiled to WebAssembly.
- **git-sdk** - Client side git implementation that takes over cloning a repository.
- **git-server** - Server that host git repositories. Think of GitHub.

## Goals

- Focus on iteration speed.
  - We deal with high uncertainty. The faster we can iterate, the better we can react to changing requirements.
- Focus on DX when using the SDK.
  - How easy can developers use the git backend? We intend to offer version control as a backend to external developers.
- The implementation must be de-coupled from inlang.
  - Inlang provides requirements that are _most likely_ universal across apps that build on git. But, the git-sdk should be de-coupled from inlang to enable developers to use the sdk to build own apps.

## Non-goals

- Architect the perfect system based on currently known requirements.
  - The requirements will change. We can’t architect the perfect system now.

## Requirements

> Anything using `> ` syntax is taken from @araknast great RFC answers: https://gist.github.com/araknast/2308fa58e49112ff112c415f4fb7531a

> To be merged together into 1 RFC

### Not coupled to the browser [High Confidence]

The git-sdk must run on the server, in a VSCode extension, in CI/CD, in the browser. In short, everywhere.

The model to run the git-sdk everywhere is simple: have a filesystem. All environments except for the browser have a filesystem concept. Thus, we need to build a filesystem implementation for the browser.

#### JS

isomorphic-git already runs in both browser and node environments which covers everything.

#### WASM

libgit2 when compiled to wasm with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) creates 3 files: `lg2.html`, `lg2.js` and `lg2.wasm` (~ 833 KB).

The `lg2.js` file includes [Emscripten File System](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html) with already configured bindings to call into `lg2.wasm` and save results in the file system.

By default [MEMFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#memfs) is used which is in-memory and thus runs in both browser and node environments.

Example below is making `git clone` and saving results into mounted MEMFS.

```js
FS.mkdir("/");
FS.mount(MEMFS, {}, "/");
FS.chdir("/");
libgit.callMain(["clone", "https://github.com/inlang/inlang.git", "inlang"]);
FS.chdir("inlang");
```

##### What to do when users provide file system as argument?

The code in `lg2.js` should be changed to instead of using wasm-integrated Emscripten FS, it uses passed in file system.

Inlang can also expose a package like [memfs](https://github.com/streamich/memfs) that would provide [MEMFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#memfs) like file system that users can pass as argument to git-sdk.

##### Running GitSDK WASM in browser (web worker)

If running git-sdk-wasm [in web worker](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git#example-webworker-with-pre-built-binaries), all git/fs operations won't be blocking the main JS thread.

However then the file system must be synced via message passing between the web worker and browser js thread.

As we can't run all logic in a web worker as the file system must be exposed to users and not be abstracted, to avoid message passing syncing, there should be no web worker used.

##### Running GitSDK WASM in browser

You can instead run git-sdk [in a browser](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git#use-in-browser-without-a-webworker). The package will be making async requests to `lg2.wasm` by passing the required commands.

The difficulty is with bundling the `.wasm` file with the package. Can use rollup for this.

##### Running GitSDK WASM in Node

Whilst [MEMFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#memfs) can be used inside node environments, there is also [NODEFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#nodefs) file system that can only run in Node.

### Client-side implementation [High Confidence]

Solving git limitations client-side, in the git-sdk, simplifies application architectures and is large part of inlang’s “the next git” thesis.

Problems we are running into are identical on both the server and client. For example, reducing the bandwidth/time to clone a repository: Moving git-sdk logic to the server only shifts the problem to the server, but doesn’t solve it. The client would need to wait for the server to finish cloning of the repositories. Instead, the git-sdk can be adjusted to support lazy loading of files and thereby automatically solve long cloning times client- and server side.

### Lazy loading of files and git history [High Confidence]

Oftentimes only a subset of files in git repositories are required. Only cloning files and their history that is needed substantially reduces network and storage requirements. A lazy loading solution is likely coupled with the filesystem implementation.

```jsx
/**
 * An example lazy loading implementation API.
 */

// does not clone the entire repository.
// only metadata that enable other git commands to run
await clone("https://github.com/inlang/inlang", fs);

// lazy fetches the file and git commit history of README.md
const commitHistory = await history("/README.md", fs);

// lazy fetches xyz file
const readme = await fs.readFile("/xyz.md");
```

> Implementation

> To resolve this, we exploit the functionality behind partial clones, namely the filter option to the fetch-pack wire command, and promisor pack files. We then use this to implement a sort of 'partial fetch' which, when combined with a pattern based sparse checkout, has the effect of fetching only the objects necessary to render the files we are using, and significantly speeding up the cloning process.

> Abstraction

> To make this easier for the end user, we can expose this functionality as a lazy loading filesystem which functions exactly the same as a normal filesystem, except in its implementation of readFile().

> The only modification necessary to readFile() is a hook at the very beginning which calls checkout on the current file before it is opened. Once promisor packfiles are implemented, this will handle the fetching and unpacking of the corresponding object in a way that is completely transparent to the end user.

#### JS

Isomorphic Git can now, only do shallow clones using `depth=1`. This however still fetches:

1. latest commit for each branch
2. working tree files (files associated with latest commit for each branch)
3. branch and tag references

To achieve lazy loading and only fetching things as they are needed, you neeed to add git wire protocol version 2 support, together with `filter`, `fetch-pack` wire command.

How fetch for git objects is done:

1. `git fetch` is executed on the local repository.
2. `fetch-pack` is invoked, which establishes a connection to the remote repository.
3. `fetch-pack` sends a request containing the commit hashes it wants to retrieve.
4. On the remote repository, `upload-pack` receives the request and gathers the requested objects.
5. `upload-pack` sends the objects in a packfile back to the `fetch-pack` command.
6. `fetch-pack` stores the received objects in the local repository, updating the local object database.

Adding `filter` would allow for fetching partially contents of the git server using promisor pack files.

There is a way to request for certain checked out files too. Need to know what `fetch-pack` sends when you do something like this in git:

```
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "package.json" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git checkout
```

You can also combine clone + getting the git objects for blobs in the files/folders to checkout into 1 http request. And expose it as an API in Git SDK `cloneWithCheckout()` or similar API.

Extending Isomorphic Git to achieve lazy loading is currently being explored [in a fork](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/isomorphic-git/tree/partial-clone).

#### WASM

libgit2 supports [filter](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#v0.20.0/group/filter). There is [unmerged PR for trying to add partial clones](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/5993).

There is also [open pr with sparse-checkout](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6394), not yet merged.

### Must be git compatible [High Confidence]

The data in `.git` must be up to spec to ensure compatiblity with the git ecosystem and ease adoption. The ecosystem includes GitHub, CLIs, etc.

### "Commands" like `clone` do not necessarily need to be up to spec [Medium Confidence]

Changes in the `.git` subdirectory like commits must obey to the git spec but the “way to get there” e.g. commands like `clone` do not have to be up to spec. The git spec is designed for a CLI with access to a local filesystem, not an application that is running in the browser.

An interesting question arises how much of the git spec is required to operate an application like the inlang editor. A good example is `sparse checkout`. `sparse checkout` is a Git feature that enables a user to check out only a subset of files from a repository instead of the entire repository. Coming close to the lazy loading requirements of inlang? Not quite. `sparse checkout` required the knowledge of which files to load. The inlang editor has no knowledge of which files are required before cloning a repository. One might use `sparse checkout` to achieve lazy loading of files but the concept of sparse checkout could be eliminated all together if `clone` is lazy loaded by default.

### (Future) File-based auth [High Confidence | Server-related ]

Supporting features like file-based auth will require a custom git server. Translators are not supposed to have access to the entire source code if they only use a few resource (translation) files. Discussion is ongoing in [https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/153](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/153).

File-based auth seems to go hand-in-hand with “lazy cloning”. The server would only allow to clone files that the actor has access to.

> Implementation

> The simplest way to implement this while maintaining compatibility with Git is to have a modified version of the Git server which allows users the option to authenticate. Each object stored on the server is access controlled, and the server will refuse to serve objects to users who do not have permission, i.e. those objects will not be included in the packfiles sent to the user

> Issues

> First, users who are not aware of this system will receive what looks like a corrupt repo when they attempt to clone a repo for which they do not have permission to access all the objects. In order for this to work properly it is necessary for the user to run a partial clone of only the files they have access to (or use the lazy fs).

> Second, because tree objects contain the name, mode and hash of the files they reference, these attributes will potentially be visible to users even if they don't have permission to access the file (as long as they have access to the parent tree).

> If this approach is taken, these issues should be made clear in the documentation.

### (Future) Real-time collaboration [High Confidence]

The editor requires real-time collaboration. We don’t know how we are going to implement real-time collaboration yet from both a technical and design standpoint. But how is easy could the git SDK be extended to add real-time-collaboration?

Having real-time collaboration in a branch combines Google Docs style collaboration with software engineering collaboration.

> In my opinion this is best done on the frontend with something like Operational Transform, not Git for performance reasons. Once the a files edits have been resolved it can be committed normally to the repo (potentially noting the multiple contributors).

### (Future) Support for large files out of the box [Medium Confidence]

The git-sdk would need something like Git Large File Storage [https://git-lfs.com/](https://git-lfs.com/) built-in. Localization affects media files as well. Support for large files seems to go hand-in-hand with with lazy cloning i.e. the penalty of storing large files .

> Implementation

> All that is necessary for Git to manage these files is a hook when staging to convert the file to multiple Git objects, and a hook when checking out to convert multiple Git objects back to their corresponding binary format. Similar hooks exists in the form of the clean and smudge hooks, however these have files as both their input and outputs. Our implementation would be more powerful in that it would allow for 'cleaning' a file into multiple Git objects, and 'smudging' multiple Git objects into a single file.

> Finally, in order for the diffs between these binary files to be presentable to the user, we will need allow the end user to define their own 'diff' implementation to support various file types.

#### JS

Isomorphic git [does not officially support it](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/1375).

But there is [LFS compatibility layer for iso-git](https://github.com/riboseinc/isogit-lfs). Explained [here](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/discussions/1089#discussioncomment-4858642).

#### WASM

libgit2 team refers to using [filters API](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#v0.20.0/group/filter) to [achieve git lfs support](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp/issues/1236). There is no official API for Git LFS.

### (Future) Plugin system to support different files [Medium Confidence]

A plugin system could enable storing files like SQLite, Jupyter Notebooks, or binary files natively in git. If an SQLite file could be stored in git, inlang and other apps might not require dedicated servers to host data. See [https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/355](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/355).

Storing certain files in git is problematic because git uses a diffing algorithm that is suited for text files (code) but unsuited for other file formats. Having a plugin system where plugins can define the diffing algorithm for different file formats like `.ipynb` or `.sqlite` could enable a variety of new use cases.

#### JS

All git operations and file system is in JS. Plugins can be implemented as importable JS functions and follow some specification of inputs / outputs.

#### WASM

Similar to JS version, plugins can be implemented as importable JS functions and follow some specification of inputs / outputs.

Only the actual git related commands are done in WASM. By sending messages to libgit2 wasm and getting back results.

## Comparing JS architecture vs WebAssembly

- Does a JS implementation (forked from isomomorphic git) suit our needs of faster iteration speeds better than a WebAssembly implementation?
- Is a JS implementation fast enough?
  - We likely don't need a hyper optimized git implementation yet and can always optimize down the road.
- State management differences (syncing file systems etc.)?
- Ease of debugging (for faster iteration speeds). A pure JS implementation is straightforward to debug.

# Summary and Roadmap

> To summarize, I propose git-sdk should implement the following features:

> 1. Standard Git commands for interacting with repositories
> 2. Lazy loading based on fetch-pack filtering and promisor packfiles
> 3. Lightweight file-based authentication built on top of the existing Git protocol
> 4. More powerful implementations of the smudge and clean hooks, as well diff providers to support version controlling diverse filetypes

> While I propose we continue to use isomorphic-git when implementing this sdk, most of its features will be built on top of existing Git functionality, so our roadmap will look similar no matter which backend we go with

> For isomorphic-git, the roadmap will look something as follows (note the difficulty assessments in square brackets):

> 1. Update isomorphic-git to support wire protocol v2 [medium]
> 2. Implement support for promisor packfiles in isomorphic-git [medium-hard (?)]
> 3. Implement partial cloning with a filter option to git.clone [easy]
> 4. Abstract partial cloning into a lazy fs that is transparent to the user (git-sdk is born) [easy]
> 5. Implement smudge, clean, and diff providers [easy]
> 6. Create a custom server implementation for file based authentication [hard]

> If using libgit2, the roadmap would look somewhat similar:

> 1. Implement support for promisor packfiles in libgit2 [hard]
> 2. Implement partial cloning with a filter option to git.clone [medium (?)]
> 3. Abstract partial cloning into a lazy fs that is transparent to the user (git-sdk is born) [easy]
> 4. Rewrite smudge, and clean implementations for libgit2 to support multiple object input and output [hard (?)]
>    - This could be made easier if we handle this in git-sdk in a way that is transparent to libgit2, but we lose the performance benefits
> 5. Create a custom server implementation for file based authentication [hard]

> Note that [easy, medium, hard] denote the amount of work involved, not necessarily the difficulty of the problem, that difficulty is based on the assumption that the previous tasks have already been completed, and also that I am not very familiar with the libgit2 codebase, so my difficulty assessments may be incorrect

> Miscellaneous Notes

> Performance Issues in Isomorphic-git

> The largest issue faced by the inlang editor in its current iteration using isomorphic-git is the time taken to clone large repositories. The cause of this is twofold

> 1. isomorphic-git is significantly slower in indexing packfiles sent from the remote than canonical git.
> 2. the implementation of checkout in isomorphic-git suffers from a lack of optimization in determining which files to update. Where canonical Git evaluates the files in a single pass, isomorphic-git evaluates them in multiple passes causing considerable slowdown (see this comment and the comments in src/commands/checkout.js).

> With considerable effort, this could potentially be improved, but at the moment it makes more sense to focus on optimizing the usage of our Git backed (partial clones, etc.) rather than the performance of the backend itself

> Fork vs. Patch Workflow

> Git-sdk should be designed to support both major Git workflows: patch/send-email (Linux, git, sourcehut), as well as fork/PR (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). For this reason our sdk should also include functionality to generate and apply patches, which can then be used with these workflows

For optimal performance at least in the browser, you would need to do the first fetch of git objects from remote in JS. libgit2 in wasm is 833 KB and you would need to load that before even starting a connection to git remote to fetch for git objects.

If there are issues in performance in JS implementation such as indexing packfiles, checkout or serializing/deserializing lots of data, this part can be written in WASM.

One thing to note is that WebAssembly only supports numeric types like integers and floats so git objects to be worked with must be serialized before being passed to WASM to do expensive computational work.

The loading of WASM module for doing potential expensive work should be of no issue as it can be fetched in parallel as all other git objects get fetched.

## Attempt 2 of Git SDK RFC

### Questions

#### Q: If we use a JS implementation, will we run into foreseeable performance issues that would be solved by libgit2?

Nearly all git operations especially ones you'd want to do in context of a browser won't be computationally heavy.

The heaviest git operations would most likely be comitting many files but even in this case, JS can do it quite fast even on large amount of content.

> note: come up with an application idea that would need to do something heavy in git inside a browser

Currently the biggest issue that Inlang editor faces are not IO bound but its waiting for the network to get the right files and content to render.

Thus the need to implement sparse-checkout feature to only fetch specific files or folders you need.

`clone` = fetches git details from network such as files, git objects to put into .git folder (network bound)

`add` = scans over added files, create entry in `.git` (even if many files added, should be instant)

Most other git commands like `rebase` or `commit` won't do much else so all operations should be near instant.

> go through the list of to be supported git commands and be more thorough in analysis of perf

> ideally benchmark some commands

We can also potentially delegate some heavy git operations to a web worker. To run some things in parallel and not block the main and only JS thread. Given the explanation presented in the previous section, this option should not be needed. However, offloading IO or computational work to web worker and waiting for response is possible if needed.

#### Q: Does it make sense to run Isomoprphic Git and/or file system in a web worker?

No, for above reason. It's not worth the complexity and there is no need for it.

#### Q: How difficult would it be to add missing commands?

Hard to predict but Isomorphic Git has some active contributors still. For example [abortMerge](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/pull/1744) was added recently.

A `sparse-checkout` or `rebase` command would be taking that PR as template and making the logic work for respective command.

By checking out how the code is done in quite a few git implementations out there. Some have already implemented it. In the worst case, you can read main [Git code](https://github.com/git/git) and figure out how those commands work from first principles and implement them.

Paying attention that we are running in a browser context and not all details are needed, simplifies things a lot.

#### Q: Will using Isomorphic Git answer to all stated goals above?

✅ = already done
🚧 = work required
❎ = not possible

Goal 1: Must run in the browser/on the client [High Confidence] ✅

Goal 2: Lazy loading of files and git history [High Confidence] 🚧

Is achievable in a few ways. But in current state would require sparse checkout to be implemented.

Goal 3: Must be git compatible but not necessarily up to spec [Medium Confidence] ✅

No issue here. Isomorphic Git is already git compatible, if we decide to extend it with new features we can have a fork of Isomorphic Git potentially or bring commands up to spec and merge them into Isomorphic Git repo.

Goal 4: (Future) File-based auth [High Confidence | Server-related ] 🚧

Is part of server so outside of Iso Git scope.

> note: maybe wrong

Goal 5: (Future) Support for large files out of the box [Medium Confidence] 🚧

> note: need to research more to give good estimate how doable this is to add

There is [open issue on this](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git/issues/1375).

Goal 6: (Future) Plugin system to support different files [Medium Confidence] 🚧

Would be doable to add irrespective of whether libgit2 or Isomorphic Git is chosen.

#### Q: Could Git SDK abstract away the file system and expose git app focused API only?

> note: can be removed from RFC, just some thinking out loud

> also on second thought this won't make sense, seems you would need to pass a FS

> hypothethisizing making Git SDK have tight integration with the FS (might not be possible/feasible or make sense)

> only exposing the actual useful commands you would need to build Git based apps

Perhaps outside of the discussion of this RFC but still maybe interesting to discuss. Or perhaps create new RFC?

It would be potentially interesting to see a Git SDK that would also abstract working with the file system all together.

This would mean, there would be no need to pass `fs` to every git operation. You would just do:

```js
let inlang = await gitSDK.clone("https://github.com/inlang/inlang.git");
```

And you get back a fully fledged file system fetched from the repo. As the SDK is focused on running on context of browser.

Above function call can do a fetch of just enough resources to do further actions.

`git clone --depth 1 --sparse --no-checkout --filter=blob:none https://github.com/inlang/inlang`

After this an app would most likely want to fetch a file to edit. It can do:

```js
// checkout just this file and put it in the fs (using sparse-checkout)
// it returns a new inlang, so 'fs' below works and is filled with correct file system
// again this can be a signal instead or hook, not just a variable
inlang = await inlang.checkoutFile("inlang.config.js");

// `.fs` is one way you can get access to the file system
// readFile returns a string representation of the file so you can modify it
// need to think about how fs. would work
// maybe there is way to get access to fs in a better way
let inlangConfig = await inlang.fs.readFile("inlang.config.js");
// it would be great if `inlang` type definition would update on 'checkout', 'clone'
// so typescript can complain if 'inlang.config.js' file is not there

// then you can make edits to inlangConfig string that
// it could be the case that inlangConfig not a normal variable
// but a signal returned (to work with solid) or hook (for react)

// where inlangConfig is the modified version
// aware there are most likely issues with just editing file like this
// i'm sure there is a better way more streamlined way to make an edit to something and
// commit it to fs after
// this is just one example of how it can happen
inlangGit.overwriteFile("inlang.config.js", inlangConfig);

// Then git add the file
inlangGit.add("inlang.config.js");

// Commit
inlangGit.commit("inlang.config.js: update readResources");

// And git push
const conflicts = await inlangGit.push("inlang.config.js");

// Can also get conflicts on pull
const conflicts = await inlangGit.pull();

// you try fix conflicts and
inlangGit.push(); // until it succeeds
```

Sparse-checkout under the hood does this (for reference):

```
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "inlang.config.js" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git checkout
```

The API for above is quite readable and nice. And powerful too in some ways. As you don't have to think about how fetch happens. It's done for you automatically.

```js
const inlang = await gitSDK.clone("https://github.com/inlang/inlang.git", {
  depth: 1,
});
```

You can also as second arg to `clone` send some options to already fetch up to certain depth of commits or any other option that would make sense to run for Git to be run in the browser.

In many ways this opens up the API surface too and lets us explore what to expose to users and what not. A lot of complexity can be hidden away. Namely all the memfs api learning you will need to do, together with more lines of code and potential bugs.

This can be spinned up into a new RFC and discussed, just wanted to add this as it can influence the choice of whether it makes sense to go with Git compiled to WASM approach or Git in JS.

This can use either isomorphic git or libgit2 under the hood. FS implementation is abstracted away.

> note: need to read through lg2.js code to see whether Emscripten is node fs api like

> note: how would this work with real time collaboration?

> on second review this idea might not make sense as perhaps part of 'git thesis'

> is access to the fs itself, not fetched through git sdk interface

> however if that interface is indistinguishable from the file system but with git powers attached

> why pass some fs and complicate setup potentially

## Git compiled to WASM

### Context

The reason you'd want to move to libgit2 is that libgit2 supports more options out of the box. And potentially performance.

### Questions

#### Q: Is git compiled to WASM faster than JS implementation?

Most likely yes as WASM in general is faster. Compilation is done by [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

It takes the C code and creates a `.wasm` file.

libgit2 was not written with WASM in mind but it still will most likely be faster than isomorphic git.

The resulting `.wasm` file in `Release` mode is ~ 830 KB.

#### Q: What are missing APIs Git SDK will need. Does libgit2 provide them?

libgit2 is written in C. So changes to it must be made in C too if libgit2 doesn't support a certain feature.

Fortunately it seems libgit2 supports all the needed features Inlang needs. And potentially other features that other companies building on Git SDK will need.

From list shared above with checkboxes for available API. API of libgit2 is [here](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD).

#### Q: Is WASM file size issue to first load?

There is way to get wasm-git into a smaller bundle.

[NEAR viewpoint](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/near-viewpoint) is nice example of using wasm-git in a bundle that all together 10.5 KB.

#### Q: Can you keep the file system inside WASM too?

No, you can't. There is no file system in the WebAssembly runtime.

#### Q: How does the architecture with this approach look?

[WASM Git](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git) reccomends using it through a [web worker](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git#example-webworker-with-pre-built-binaries). To avoid doing operations on main thread.

When you compile libgit2 to wasm with Emscripten, as build artefacts, you get `lg2.wasm` file that is the libgit2 itself. And also `lg2.js`.

The purpose of `lg2.js` file is to provide the file system for libgit2 to sync with.

The code for `lg2.js` is quite hard to read and would need to be rewritten to be more nice to use and iterate on.

It does already do these 2 things that are useful:

1. Exposes a `libgit` variable with a `callMain` function.

You would then do:

```js
FS.mkdir("/");
FS.mount(MEMFS, {}, "/");
FS.chdir("/");
const result = libgit.callMain([
  "clone",
  "https://github.com/inlang/inlang.git",
  "inlang",
]);
FS.chdir("inlang");
```

You can expose different C functions that run the commands. For example, we have built [open pr for shallow clones](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/pull/6396) and exposed it via a new method for `callMain`:

```js
const result = libgit.callMain([
  "shallowClone",
  "https://github.com/inlang/inlang.git",
  "inlang",
]);
```

That function was same as clone, just also set `clone_opts.fetch_opts.depth` option before doing the clone. Extending libgit2 with new commands would work in the same way.

2. The `lg2.js` file also gives file system for git to work with. [Emscripten File System](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html) to be precise.

> warning: this might be false. I need to read through lg2.js to say for sure.

But essentially at least in examples provided, `FS` variables corresponds to Emscripten File System.

#### Q: Does it make sense to continue using Emscripten File System or it should be replaced with something else?

The answer to it would require more studying of how that part works to say for sure.

[libgit2 clone API](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD/group/clone/git_clone) as arg accepts `local_path` which is `local directory to clone to` and `git_repository` which is `pointer that will receive the resulting repository object`.

> note: I need to study this further to make a conclusive answer.

Currently provided `lg2.js` file seems to be doing all the file system to/from git interfacing.

#### Q: How would replacing Emscripten File System with another file system look like?

There was a proposal above to abstract the file system away from the user and expose everything via Git SDK API. If that's the case, we can continue using Emscripten File System in theory and build on top of it.

> note: needs more study, specificly that lg2.js that is the build output of wasm-git

Assuming user sends file system as argument in similar way that happens in Iso Git now.

Somehow when calls to git operations through WASM are are made, the results should be reflected in the file system.

> note: need to test this out, see output in console etc of what happens when clone happens etc.

There is documented [API on calling WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API).

Need to read through the API exposed by libgit2 to say for sure.

> note: not sure what the interface of FS that libgit2 expects, need to test

#### Q: Do you need to run Git operations in Git SDK in a web worker?

Assuming we figure out how TS communicates nicely with Git commands that get executed in WASM. And for changes to reflect in a file system provided, there would ne no need for a web worker to be there.

#### Q: Can we bundle WASM in Git SDK and abstract using WASM over nice API?

[rollup/plugin-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-wasm) can potentially be used.

However when it was used last time, there were errors.

#### Q: Will using libgit2 compiled to WASM answer to all stated goals above?

✅ = already done
🚧 = work required
❎ = not possible

Goal 1: Must run in the browser/on the client [High Confidence] ✅

Calling into `.wasm` from JS, then in turn saving everything in the FS provided.

Goal 2: Lazy loading of files and git history [High Confidence] 🚧 close to ✅ potentially

sparse checkout is supported on a fork for libgit2. It needs to be compiled and tested.

JS code needs to be written to abstract the lazy loading using sparse checkout to make it possible.

Goal 3: Must be git compatible but not necessarily up to spec [Medium Confidence] ✅

No issue here for same reason as Isomorphic Git. We use commands from libgit2 we need.

However the barrier to contributing to libgit2 itself is going to be that command is fully spec compliant so we need to be aware of that.

Goal 4: (Future) File-based auth [High Confidence | Server-related ] 🚧

Is part of server so outside of scope.

> note: maybe wrong

Goal 5: (Future) Support for large files out of the box [Medium Confidence] 🚧/✅

There is open discussion [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/375). But from looks of it, it's supported but may bring issues.

Goal 6: (Future) Plugin system to support different files [Medium Confidence] 🚧

Would be doable to add irrespective of whether libgit2 or Isomorphic Git is chosen.

## Conclusion

Having written above, I believe going with libgit2 compiled to WASM option will allow us to potentially move faster in near future. As we won't need to implement sparse-checkout and rebase.

Both features need some git know how and time to implement.

With libgit2 we get those features out of the box.

Performance is not a concern in either case so the other focus is on DX.

I think you can provide the same Git SDK API regardless whether Isomorphic Git is chosen or libgit2 to do git operations.

As for regretting choose either technology in the future. We would potentially need to think through different kinds of applications that will be built with Git SDK. Some are done as part of this RFC below.

If many features will not be available in libgit2, then it would most likely make more sense to use Isomorphic Git as it's much easier to iterate on JS code than C (potentially).

## Implementation details

### Implementation details for Isomorphic Git

> Potentially out of scope of this RFC but are here to give more context to questions/answers above

> Can be used to approximate amount of work needed to complete the transition

Iso Git works by attaching a file system to all the commands. Many of primitives for working with `.git` content is exposed via functions in Isomorphic Git.

For sparse git checkout of particular file, here is CLI version:

```
git clone --depth 1 --sparse --no-checkout --filter=blob:none https://github.com/inlang/inlang
cd inlang
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "inlang.config.js" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git checkout
```

You can do normal [clone](https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/clone) already but that takes too long. Shallow clone with depth 1 is available but that still takes 10+ seconds on some repos.

So to implement a sparse checkout of just one file or folder, you would need to implement these options inside Iso Git.

There is no `sparse` option. There is no `--filter=blob:none` option. No `--no-checkout` either. You have to implement all 3 if you want to do a fast clone of just minimal git info to get going.

![Options eplained](https://images.nikiv.dev/git-clone-explained-23.png)

> Why you need the options

![Options eplained](https://images.nikiv.dev/git-clone-explained-2-23.png)

There is also a way to achieve above with `git init` and orphan branch. Speed wise, they are the same. In `git init` you just create a folder yourself.

We don't technically need to do `git config core.sparseCheckout true` as we don't need to be up to git spec. There is [setConfig](https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/setConfig) option though so it's no issue to do this part.

`echo "inlang.config.js" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout` tells sparse-checkout what to checkout on next `git checkout`.

So we need to figure out what happens when `git checkout` happens in `sparseCheckout` true mode. The `sparse-checkout` file looks like this:

```
/*
!/*/
inlang.config.js
packages/web/localizations
```

It lists paths to checkout. So need to figure out how to do a git fetch with just those files. [Fetch](https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/fetch) needs to be adapted for it.

For rebase, it might be easier too as it's implemented in quite a few git implementations unlike sparse-checkout surprisingly. So can translate that code to JS.

My understanding of rebase is that it shold take a look at some commits and turn them into one. This should be doable to do with some git primitives exposed by isomorphic git.

If we can implement rebase and sparse-checkout, adding other commands shouldn't be a problem to implement either.

Performance should be of no concern. You are not doing anything heavy as far as operations go.

### Implementation details for WASM Git

Git is compiled to wasm using libgit2. Right now with wasm-git when it builds, it provides .wasm file. And one .js file emitted by Emscripten I think that comes with the FS and exposes a function `libgit` and maybe more things.

You can then call `libgit.main()` to send commands to actual git. If it's a clone, it will clone it into Emscripten FS, exposed via `FS` global variable.

Git WASM gives 2 examples in repo, one in [web worker](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git#example-webworker-with-pre-built-binaries) and 1 in [browser](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git#use-in-browser-without-a-webworker).

## Adding folder for storing metadata (no modification to git itself)

The problem of storing generalized metadata will be present across all git based apps.

In Inlang, there is currently [no ability to track which translations were machine translated](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/462).

One solution is to have a custom [folder for storing metadata](https://github.com/orgs/inlang/discussions/355). Metadata such as comments/images/ etc.

Assuming we decide to store all metadata in folder.

We will cover the case of 'Modyfing git to become a proper backend' after.

### JS

You would be able to fetch the metadata folder via sparse-checkout clone. And read the metadata as it will be just files in a file system.

Comitting/pushing files is trvial too. The only missing piece is adding sparse-checkout into isomorphic-git. All the remainder of git operations one would need to be able to work with a metadata folder should be covered already by existing featureset of isomorphic git.

Not tested yet, but it should hopefully respect `.gitignore` placed inside the metadata folder too, but if it doesn't it's trivial to add as a feature too.

### WASM

Similar to Isomorphic Git, this would be trivial to add on top of libgit2 wasm.

You would sparse-checkout the folder with metadata. Only difference is that as it currently stands, you are forced to save results into [Emscripten FS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html).

The way libgit2 works now as compiled through [wasm-git](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git) is you get 1 .wasm file. And one .js file. The JS file contains the Emscripten FS and bindings to libgit2 git.

[MEMFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#memfs) is default in-memory file system mounted. Example code how that looks below:

There is also [NODEFS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#nodefs) you can use for when git-sdk runs in Node.

NODEFS uses native Node.js 'fs' module under the hood to access the host file system.

One of stated goals of git sdk is it should run anywhere there is a file system. You provide the file system and git sdk does the rest.

The interface of the file system provided by users to git sdk can be adapted to cover the API surface of MEMFS or NODEFS depending on the environment they are running git sdk in.

Above was needed context to answer the question regarding adding support for the custom folder to hold metadata about repository.

libgit2 supports the features needed to sparse-checkout the metadata folder and mount it into the file system. From then on, you can read/modify the contents of the files.

## Modify git to become a proper backend

Here is summary of [points made by Samuel on kinds of things one would need for git as a backend](https://github.com/orgs/inlang/discussions/355#discussioncomment-4875403). Let's go through each one and see how JS or WASM solutions compare in solving them.

## Not every change needs to be committed

Should be solvable irregardless of WASM/JS solution chosen for Git. Just do all the non comittable work on top of the FS. And only commit changes you need.

## Git provides real-time collaboration

Should also be solvable irregardless of WASM/JS solution chosen for Git.

You can build real-time collaboration features on top of the FS api. Using operational transforms or other tech.

Only when you want to commit and persist the changes, would you talk to Git and there all required git features are supported.

Conflict resolution can be built in JS side irregardless if actual git is implemented in JS or WASM.

> Perhaps I am missing a case where you would actually need to change some core git behavior in order to make above work? I don't see it.

## Built-in auth via auth as code

From [comment](https://github.com/orgs/inlang/discussions/355#discussioncomment-4875403):

> Apps don't need an auth layer anymore. organization can configure auth as they please and need. Potentially revolutionizing here as well. If that auth layer is also able to hook into databases like sqlite

From [authorization and file-based security issue](https://github.com/orgs/inlang/discussions/153).

> The editor clones a whole repository. Especially for private repositories, file-based access control is desired. A translator should only be able to clone translation relevant files

> Implementing a custom git server with auth as code like https://www.osohq.com/ could enable the feature. The cumbersome authorization path, see (reversed) #303, could simultaneously be streamlined by leveraging such a git server as auth layer

Assume that would mean, Git SDK would need a custom git server with certain rules for this to work.

> TODO: need expanding, don't fully understand how that'd work. This would probably actually need changes made to git core potentially
