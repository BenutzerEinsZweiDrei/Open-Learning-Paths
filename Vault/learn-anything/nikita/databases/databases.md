# Databases

Currently prefer using [Grafbase](../networking/graphql/grafbase.md) or [PlanetScale](planetscale.md) as my data store for web apps. And [SQLite](sqlite.md) for when I need local DB. [Turso](https://chiselstrike.com/) is nice for deploying SQLite.

In perfect world [EdgeDB](edgedb.md) gets replication for lower latency. It builds on top of [Postgres](postgresql.md) & has [amazing query language](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/index) & [declarative schema modeling](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/index). Maybe EdgeDB can combine [Neon](https://neon.tech/)'s work on making multi-cloud, autoscaling Postgres.

[Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/) & [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) are great books on databases.

[Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) is a great SQL queries visualizer. [Database access optimization doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/optimization/) is a good read.

[Ditto](https://www.ditto.live/), [Replicache](https://replicache.dev/) & [Tuple Database](https://github.com/ccorcos/tuple-database) are fascinating tools for for [syncing local state for fast network bound operations](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1528848433968209923) using [CRDTs](../distributed-systems/crdt.md) and other tools. [PlanetScale](planetscale.md) seems awesome too.

Also trying out [Cozo Graph DB](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo), has [many sleek features](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33518320).

[trustfall](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall) is a great query engine for all kinds of data sources. [Atlas](https://github.com/ariga/atlas) is nice DB tool.

[toyDB](https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb) & [minikeyvalue](https://github.com/geohot/minikeyvalue) has nice code to study.

[Slashbase](https://slashbase.com/) is nice GUI app to talk with databases.

[LSM in a Week](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm), [TinyKV Course](https://github.com/talent-plan/tinykv) & [How Query Engines Work](https://howqueryengineswork.com/) are great resources.

## Notes

- [Database queries are especially fast if you copy the database into RAM.](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1380240448606756865)
- [More than likely images/videos are stored in something like AWS S3 and the database would just have links to them. It is possible to store an image straight up in a database though but it would be as a blob/buffer data that is then turned back into an image on the client. The blob/base64 string way can be slower/probably not recommended. For fast load/performance they'd use caching/cdn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/moj0rb/how_do_websites_store_videos_and_images_can_this/)
- [It's good to start any app design with database schema and mock the UI to connect them.](https://lobste.rs/s/dgb7xh/i_always_design_database_schema_first)
