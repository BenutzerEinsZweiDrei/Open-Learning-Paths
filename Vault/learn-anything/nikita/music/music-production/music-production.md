# Music production

[Abletone Learning Synth](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/) is nice intro. [Never Before Heard Sounds](https://heardsounds.com/) is working on some [neat tech](https://twitter.com/yotammann/status/1532446436314402817).

Sometimes use [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) & [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) to make music.

[Omni](https://github.com/vitreo12/omni) & [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) are interesting.

As [Nils Frahm](https://www.nilsfrahm.com/) is my favorite artist and I love his [synthesizer setup](https://equipboard.com/pros/nils-frahm). I want to get into it playing [synths](synthesizers.md)/[pianos](piano.md) more. [Hania Rani](https://haniarani.com/) & [Ólafur Arnalds](https://olafurarnalds.com/) have great songs I want to learn to play too.

[Riffusion](https://github.com/riffusion/riffusion) & [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) & [WebAssembly Music](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/javascriptmusic) are interesting.
