- Unhealthy obsession is destructive. Free your mind. Fill your time and fully focus on [things you love doing](../ideas/index.md) as you get over unrequited love. [It will pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K3ffDrignk).
- You don't need anyone, including a partner to live a [happy and fulfilling life](../life/happiness.md). Just be your best, happy self. Whatever happens, happens. Be assertive with your actions/intentions but don't force anything if there is any conflict/resistance. One message is enough.

- Twitter/Reddit/Instagram/GitHub, get literal name if available. On Twitter, lowercasing the name looks good (Twitter will show your custom real name in searches already). Can [capitalize](https://twitter.com/khanacademyeng) username if its multiple words (can rename username if needed). Capitalize [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApolloApp/) subreddit name as it stands out better in searches & its more recognizable (the name can't be changed later so capitalize even if one word). GitHub is good [lowercased](https://github.com/learn-anything), literal name or with dashes. If name is taken, can add `_` or [HQ](https://twitter.com/SlackHQ)/[App](https://twitter.com/SparkMailApp)/[Inc](https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc) in the end or prefix with [get](https://twitter.com/getairbridge) or [use](https://twitter.com/usefathom). For Instagram, if literal name is taken, it's possible to get domain name literal like [narative.co](https://www.instagram.com/narative.co/). Can use [namecheckr](https://www.namecheckr.com/) to check for available names.
- For domains, get literal name, avoid dashes. Keep it to one registrar (Google Domains preferred). Prefer `.com`, ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)), `.co` ([vsco.co](https://vsco.co/)) or `.io` ([codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)) for generic sites. If it's an app, can use `.app` ([linear.app](https://linear.app)), can also have app in name like [feyapp.com](https://feyapp.com) if `.app` is taken. Developer related, `.dev` ([web.dev](https://web.dev)) is good. Organization, then `.org.` ([telegram.org](https://telegram.org/)). ML related, `.ai` ([deepcode.ai](https://www.deepcode.ai/)) can be good. Design related, `.design` is good ([baseweb.design](https://baseweb.design/)). Video related, `.tv` is good ([rewatch.tv](https://rewatch.tv/)). Otherwise, `.so`, ([notion.so](https://www.notion.so/)), `.xyz` ([learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz)), `.sh` ([apex.sh](https://apex.sh/)) are good. Can also play on domain name like [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) if possible. Make domain name memorable.

## JS/TS

- [No `export default`. Just export.](https://twitter.com/diegohaz/status/1597794428928020482)

## React

- [PascalCase component file naming](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react#naming). [no-semi Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#semicolons). Keep useStates declared together in one block. Separate declarations semantically (states > contexts/refs/.. > useEffect > functions > render).

## NextJS

- Lowercase files for pages. CamelCase components & files.

## Other

- Keep water/beverages that can possibly be spilled away from mac. Once had my dog trip a charging wire that then spilled tea kettle on my mac and broke keyboard.
