# Ergonomics

Most important thing I always try to be mindful of is keeping straight back (no slouching). Good chair / standing desk is super useful in that regard. As well as taking breaks walking/cycling or doing some sport. Straight back with some kind of [exercise](../fitness/exercises.md) daily should be enough to keep my body healthy for long time I think. I try to do some kind of [strength training](../fitness/strength-training.md) workout weekly too.

I use [Herman Miller Embody](https://esgaming.hermanmiller.com/products/embody-gaming-chair-black) with [standing desk](https://esgaming.hermanmiller.com/collections/menu/products/nevi-gaming-desk-black-black) I like. I try work with clean air around whether its from the open windows or by being outside.

I can't stand working on chairs that don't let me relax my spine properly. If I do it often enough I actually get pains in the back.

Together with above, I try do many [exercises](../fitness/exercises.md) that target my back muscles. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/comments/t7guck/fix_your_spine_a_goldmine_of_practices_for_better/) is a list of many great exercises for this.

I found when I don't have proper table/chair to work from it's not as bad to work in bed by lying down on the stomach with pillow under the chin and Macbook in front. The spine is stretched out and there is no unnecessary pressure anywhere. It's much nicer than sitting on chairs where you are forced to slouch or put pressure to keep proper posture.

My favorite work setup is something [like this](https://twitter.com/neee_eeed/status/1619368842677059584) but with proper chair/table. And silent surroundings.

## Notes

- [Start stretching (first) and then exercising (eg. build muscle). Not begin able to sit correctly usually means weak muscles. Sitting all day means certain muscle shorten and the typical nerd neck and rounded shoulders syndrome which can only be solved by stretching and exercise. Better chair won't solve the issue long term. Option would also be a height adjustable desk. So you work standing at least 15 min per hour or something like that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/tgt1h8/whats_the_best_chair_for_someone_who_spends_a_lot/)
