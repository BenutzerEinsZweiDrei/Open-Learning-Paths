# Health

I try to maximize my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) and quality of life through proper [nutrition](nutrition/index.md), [exercise](../fitness/index.md) and stress free outlook on life with [mindfulness](../mindfulness/index.md).

- [Nutrition](nutrition/index.md) - Eat whole food pescatarian nutritious diet. With [essential supplements](nutrition/supplements.md).
- [Mindfulness](../mindfulness/index.md) - Stress [shortens telomeres](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12114022) & accelerates aging. Practice being in moment, being stoic & calm.
- [Proper sleep](../sleep/index.md) - I go to sleep ~ 11/12 pm ideally and wake up without alarm getting as much sleep as my body needs.
- [Exercise](../fitness/index.md) - Start every morning with some exercise. Go on walks or do exercise throughout the day when possible.
- [Dental care](teeth.md) - Brush my teeth daily with occasional flossing.
- [Skin care](skin-care.md) - Cleanse, moisturize and apply serums to my skin every morning/evening. Together with applying sunscreen in mornings.
- [Ergonomics](ergonomics.md) - Sit properly or stand, keeping good posture throughout the day. Never slouch my back and sit for long times. Take breaks. Use good chair & desk.

These health focuses are part of my [life rules](../focusing/rules.md).

Like listening to [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrewHubermanLab/videos) & [Rhonda Patrick](https://www.youtube.com/c/FoundMyFitness/videos) for health tips.

[Foundations of Physical and Mental Performance](https://tim.blog/2023/03/08/dr-andrew-huberman/) is amazing listen.

[Tools for Hormone Optimization](https://hubermanlab.com/dr-kyle-gillett-tools-for-hormone-optimization-in-males/) is nice episode.
