# Skin care

There are 3 [effective ways to improve your skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrElyY7MFVs):

1. [Sun screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LF0Mkn-pOM)
2. [Moisturizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfck1vmlHI) ([sun screen I use](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics) acts as moisturizer too)
3. [Retinoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grxmyM7EuDk)

My goals are to have a [healthy skin with minimal wrinkles in future, ideally with some healthy skin glow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eScT7hr3r8).

My skin care routine is variation of [Geek & Gorgeous Age Smart Kit](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/kits/products/age-smart-kit). It's good to know difference between [cleanser/toner/serums/moisturizer](https://www.dermstore.com/blog/in-what-order-do-i-apply-my-skin-care-products-infographic/) & [how to apply each one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM9rX3SqB34). And use [proven to work ingredients](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpfuksjS7LA).

I keep all products I use at my sink except [vitamin c serum](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/c-glow), which lives in the fridge to prolong it. However I move small amounts of the serum from the fridge into a [mini-bottle](https://geekandgorgeous.com/products/c-glow-mini-bottle) to keep at my sink without it going bad.

[It’s best to let each product dry and absorb before the next one is applied](https://www.verishop.com/blog/beauty/skincare/how-much-time-between-skincare-products/). And don't apply any active ingredients except cleanser & sun screen to eye area. And [do it gently](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lltp2v/comment/gnsljzr/).

Below routine is aspirational, I often don't apply all the products outlined but do try to at least apply sun screen daily.

### Morning

I first do my morning [exercise routine](../fitness/index.md) and shower. Then:

1. [[Cleanse](https://youtu.be/h05frUE9dkE?t=765)] Wet face, squeeze [Jelly Joker cleanser](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/jelly-joker) into palm and gently, but thoroughly massage over face, neck and eye area. ~ 1 minute. Rinse well with warm water and pat dry. Important to dry as vitamin C should be applied on dry skin ideally.
2. [[Vitamin C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Mlbf_oOPg)] Apply few drops of [C-Glow](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/c-glow) to the face. Put a drop directly onto your face and quickly pat it on with your other hand. Pat any excess product onto the top of your hands or neck. Let it absorb. I brush my teeth as I wait. Takes ~ 2 minutes.
3. [[Beta-Glucan](https://youtu.be/1dRABL4pKmI?t=251)] Apply few drops of [Stress Less](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/stress-less) to the face. Let it absorb. ~ 1 minute.
4. [[Moisturizer / Sun screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rAOLvHX_-8)] Apply [Relief Sun](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics) to both face, neck and back of the hand. Let it absorb.

During the day, I drink a lot of water/[tea](nutrition/drinks/tea.md). I try not touch my face with dirty hands and [trim my nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF6smAEFbNE). I also try be as relaxed as I can be no matter the situation. Relaxed face without any frowning.

I also avoid sun bathing on sunny days and apply extra sun screen on exposed body parts when going surfing or playing beach volleyball or generally spending prolonged time in the sun.

### Evening

Before going to sleep, I do another exercise routine and quick shower. Then I do:

1. [[Cleanse](https://youtu.be/h05frUE9dkE?t=765)] Wet face, squeeze [Jelly Joker cleanser](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/jelly-joker) into palm and gently, but thoroughly massage over face, neck and eye area. ~ 1 minute. Rinse well with warm water and pat dry.
2. [[Exfoliant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KqPDKKGxcs)] Apply [Cheer Up](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/exfoliants/products/cheer-up) with your hands and pat it on as men do with after-shave. Avoid the area around the eyes. Let it absorb. I brush my teeth as I wait.
3. [[Retinal](https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-apply-retinol/)] Apply pea sized amount of [A-Game 5](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) on dry face skin & neck, avoid eye area. Let it absorb.
4. [[Moisturizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLNbN0YMBWk)] Apply [Hydration Station](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/hydration-station) on already slightly wet skin. Use as much or as little as your skin needs.
5. Go to sleep. Always use fresh sheets especially on the pillows.

At night, I try to sleep [either on my back or side](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions). Although I do fall asleep fastest when sleeping on my stomach. Unfortunately, sleeping on your stomach, can [cause wrinkles to form](https://www.allure.com/story/side-stomach-sleeping-causes-lines-wrinkles).

When I first started above evening routine, I didn't apply Exfoliant and Retinal on same day for first 2-3 weeks to get my skin to adjust to active ingredients. So I did one day Exfoliant and next day Retinal. Now I can do both on same day with no problems but that may vary for you.

When showering, I use [Cafferonic Body Wash](https://koreanskincare.nl/products/snp-prep-cafferonic-body-wash).

### Other tips

I sadly have a bunch of deep scars I got from having severe acne when I was young. Trying to fix it up with [microneedling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPWycy8cwN8).

Found [exercising](../fitness/exercises.md) often, good [sleep](../sleep/index.md) and clean [wholefoods pescatarian diet](nutrition/index.md) with lots of water/[tea](nutrition/drinks/tea.md) to have noticeable effect on the skin, especially its healthy color.

[Skin Care Addiction subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) is insightful. Also enjoyed [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv0ISHGGw1A) & [overview of skin care essentials (in Russian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysXauvhv2Uw) by founder of [Don't Touch My Skin](https://dtmskin.com/) (great skin care company based in Russia).

## Notes

- [SPF is absolutely crucial - every day, whatever the weather! Most skin ageing is due to small amounts of sun exposure over time. Retinol is the anti-aging ingredient with the most scientific and dermatologist backing, so you could introduce a retinol serum. The Ordinary, The Inkey List, and Face Theory all have very good, affordable options. You could also use an eye cream that targets fine lines and dark circles, but your regular moisturiser round the eyes is probably fine unless it says otherwise on the packaging. Also, make sure you are doing all of your skincare on your neck too, that's where ageing shows first and we often neglect it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/zalmi2/what_skincare_staples_should_those_of_us_pushing/)
- [Tanning is not good for your skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BqrSAHbTc).
- [More water. More sleep. Less alcohol, less smoking, and less sugar. For most people that'd drop about ten years off of their visible age.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/lksj1l/what_are_your_favorite_nutritional_tricks_for/)
- [La roche posay toleraine cleansers are nice. If you have dry skin the hydrating one is amazing, and if you have oily skin, the purifying foaming one. If you have acne prone skin, the inkey list salicylic acid cleanser every other night will be highly effective.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/um98eu/what_are_some_the_top_products_recommended_by/)
- [Research has shown that order of application doesn’t matter as much as people think, except for sunscreen usage. Sun screen should be applied about 10 minutes before sun exposure. That includes prolonged exposure by windows, which most of the time do not filter UVA rays. The 10 minute window allows the sunscreen to set on your skin and create a protective barrier, even though the active ingredients are functional upon application. It should also be the last thing you apply before makeup if applicable, to disturb the barrier as little as possible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ebhfgg/product_question_pyunkang_yul_moisture_ampoule/)
- [Retinol should be applied to skin after cleansing and toning and prior to moisturizers, night creams, eye creams, and treatment oils. Avoid using additional active ingredients at the same time as retinol to avoid skin sensitization. You should always use a daily SPF to help protect the skin from UV exposure. If dryness, sensitivity, or peeling occurs, use a skin moisture barrier replenishing product either all over or simply as a targeted spot treatment.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kiehls_Official/comments/w7yvwr/reduce_the_appearance_of_%EF%AC%81ne_lines_in_%EF%AC%81ve_days/)
- [Toners are light water based solutions which are used to clean your pores. Generally it is used after a cleanser. Serums - they have concentrated forms of ingredients to target your specific skin issues. Moisturizer - as name suggests it is used to keep your skin moist. It is generally applied after cleansing and toning your face. There are different moisturizers for different skin types from which we can choose one for our skin type.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-toners-serums-and-moisturizers)
- [Thinnest to thickest is good rule for skin care products. It is about the order in which you apply products with high water content and those with higher oil content. We all know oil and water repel each other and never mix, so you can imagine what happens when you apply a product with more oil above the product with more water content.](https://millbrookmall.com/2021/06/11/the-real-reasons-we-layer-skincare-products-from-thinnest-to-thickest/)
- [Clean your eyes. The skin is delicate but that doesn’t mean you should avoid the area. When you’re cleaning just don’t do it aggressively or tug at the skin. Also, put enough cleanser where your fingers can glide over the area easily.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/lltp2v/skin_concerns_are_you_supposed_to/)
- The skin in your eye area is still skin so you can cleanse and moisturize the area. Just do it gently
- [The skin is thinner around your eyes so the main discouragement for using retinol around the eyes is skin sensitivity/sensitizing. Until your skin is accustomed to retinol, you should put a layer of moisturizer or eye cream as a buffer around your eyes, and let it settle before applying retinol there. It can be drying and your eye area is pretty delicate. And as long as you’re using retinol around your eyes, your eye skin will be more sensitized and susceptible to sun damage which could negatively impact what you’re trying to address. A good eye cream/moisturizer and diligent spf use to protect it should be enough, but it is a thing to be mindful of. When I use retinol around my eyes - I don’t do it every time I use it on my face - I’ll put SPF on in two stages the morning after. First stage is just the eyelid and undereye/concern areas, and then the second is everywhere else including my eyes again. A sunscreen that doesn’t sting is pretty important for this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusSkincare/comments/ur9tda/best_way_to_use_retinol_around_eyes/)
- [Changing my outlook from “what skincare product looks cool and good for my skin” to “what specific issues are happening with my skin, which one do I want to fix first, and which ingredients are scientifically proven to treat it”. Halved the length of my skincare routine, saving time and money, and I’m targeting issues with laser focus rather than doing a bit of everything, meaning I have much better results.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/z262yq/misc_what_small_thing_has_made_a_big_difference/)

- [See a cosmetic dermatologist for a consultation. They are more focused on aesthetics where a regular derm might just say you’re fine, your acne is clear. There are many options. Topical retinoids are the cheapest and easiest thing to try first for collagen building. Then your derm can consider tca cross, rf microneedling, lasers etc. Multiple treatments are usually needed but people can get really good results. Google image search each of those options before and after.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/12vgyxz/acne_my_acne_scars_are_ruining_my_life/)
