# Aging

The sad reality is [lifespan seems programmed into our genes](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1645001843355820033), just like it is for fruit flies or pets. Perhaps this can be solved with gene therapy.

Some argue that aging a disease and thus can potentially be cured. For example, [Turritopsis dohrnii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii) jelly fish ages backwards.

[Information theory of aging](https://youtu.be/CwQMMzoeH9s?t=4959) is fascinating as described in [this paper](<https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01570-7#%20>).

I personally don't plan to live for long once my body starts truly breaking down of age. I maximize the quality of my [life](../life/index.md) experience through proper [sleep](../sleep/index.md), [exercise](../fitness/exercises.md) and having [no stress](../mindfulness/index.md) optimistic outlook. I don't have any negative thoughts about [death](../life/death.md) as all things end, including [our universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA). Only thing that's annoying is pain. Especially chronic. So best [try avoid that](https://twitter.com/statto/status/1595398429018312705) (that includes prisons, [diseases](../medicine/diseases/index.md)..).

One way to solve aging sooner is to work on getting closer to [AGI](../machine-learning/artificial-intelligence.md) and have it solve it.

Like the advice of: [try everything, figure out what you do best, make money from it. Stop caring what people think about you early](https://www.tiktok.com/@_notesformen/video/7167063418308971781). I try define these kind of [rules and more for myself](../focusing/rules.md).

[Blueprint](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/) has [interesting ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXdEPiFlqH8). I love that it's [vegan](../environment/veganism.md) based too. Trying to adapt [some ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rs_JK-pTTQ) from it as my goals with respect to [health](index.md) and longevity are to maximize [happiness](../life/happiness.md) too and Bryan's method while it [can work](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/132627i/bryan_johnson_blocks_andrew_steele_for_suggesting/), does so at the expense of some life satisfaction.

I quite like my [morning](../focusing/processes.md#mroning)/[day](../focusing/processes.md#day)/[evening](../focusing/processes.md#evening) routines. That plus following some basic [rules](../focusing/rules.md) regarding [health](index.md) and [exercise](../fitness/exercises.md) is enough to hopefully give me a rather happy prolonged life.

You won't find all of those in a 25 year old developer. The only way that age becomes a detriment is if you do not grow. I worked with someone my age who only strong skills are a large enterprise storage system. He is a dinosaur and his future is limited. That's not his age, its the way he chose to build is CV.
