# Supplements

Below is aspirational and doesn't always happen but I try to strive towards some kind of [routine](../../focusing/habits.md) in meeting my micro/macro needs [nutrition](index.md) wise.

Especially for supplements or extra nutritional powders outlined above, I make sure to mostly get all my nutrients from simply [eating whole foods. No added sugar. Whilst properly hydrating with water](https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-nutrition-and-supplementation-for-fitness/) or [tea](drinks/tea.md).

[Foundations of Physical and Mental Performance](https://tim.blog/2023/03/08/dr-andrew-huberman/) is amazing listen.

My [morning routine](../../focusing/processes.md#morning) is simple. After I do a walk with [small bodyweight workout](../../fitness/index.md), I make my daily breakfast of:

4 eggs fried + salad (tomatoes + avocado + feta + ..). And take my 2 omega 3 pills + 1 magnesium pill.

When time/money allows I also try to do a [smoothie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUGQBV5B2S4). I am still experimenting on making taste/health well. Most often I just drink a lot of [tea](drinks/tea.md).

## Smoothie

Some general ingredients, I don't add everything at once but often mix between these things.

- 2 scoops of [Clean Lean Protein (Just Natural taste)](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/clean-lean-protein) (~ 25g)
- 1 scoop of [Good Green Vitality](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/good-green-vitality) (~ 10g)
- 1 tea spoon of [Master Blend Mushroom Extracts](https://vibemushrooms.ca/products/master-blend)
- 1 scoop of [Creatine](https://nootropicsdepot.com/creatine-monohydrate-200-mesh-powder/) (~ 2g)
- 2 raw eggs
- Spinach (for extra fiber)
- Frozen blueberries (for better taste + healthy)
- Plain greek yogurt (for texture)
- Fill with [Alpro Unsweetened Almond Milk](https://www.alpro.com/uk/products/drinks/almond-drinks/almond-roasted-no-sugars/) (fill the blender glass)
- Chia, hemp and flax seeds with walnuts on top (not much)

Many times I miss doing this blend as I am either traveling or saving money.

After drinking the smoothie, I also take these supplements, inspired by [Rhonda Patrick](https://fastlifehacks.com/dr-rhonda-patricks-supplements-list/):

- [Vegan Omega 3 DHA](https://www.solgar.com/products/omega-3-vegetarian-dha-200-mg-vegetarian-softgels/) (3 capsules)
- [D3 + Calcium/Magnesium](https://www.solgar.com/products/calcium-magnesium-with-vitamin-d3-tablets/) (5 capsules)
- [B12](https://www.solgar.com/products/vitamin-b12-1000-mcg-nuggets/) (1 capsule)

That's often enough to get me going until afternoon at which point, I will either make some cooked food or eat out ([healthy](index.md)).

I don't try to manage my eating of generally healthy natural whole food pescatarian food. Especially as I try to lead a more active lifestyle already.

I generally strictly avoid sugary foods, snacks and drinks. Makes me appreciate the finer tastes of non processed foods and ways you can cook them. I try to experiment with various [pescatarian recipes](recipes.md) often too.

I sometimes don't eat during evenings so as to [fast](fasting.md) just a little before I take my morning smoothie on following day.

Also whilst not strictly supplements, I enjoy taking [psychedelics](../../drugs/psychedelics/index.md) with breaks of at least 2+ months. [Tryptamines](../../drugs/psychedelics/tryptamines/index.md) being my favorite, usually consumed through actual home grown [psilocybin mushrooms](../../other/mushrooms.md) & not some [research chemical](../../drugs/research-chemicals.md) like [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT).

## Notes

- [Pregnant women taking 1,000 mg of the omega-3 DHA had 50% fewer early preterm births than women given 200 mg. The high dose DHA also reduced feeding issues and genitourinary and neurologic problems in infants (randomized controlled trial).](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1397251661618352133)
- [Recent study suggests anti inflammatory meds contribute to chronic pain by preventing an inflammatory process that resets the pain baseline. We have been using these for decades and didnâ€™t catch this. This should make you nervous about playing Guinea pig.](https://twitter.com/karnagraha/status/1528490268546068480)
- [Iron is needed in the electron transport chain as a component of cytochrome C oxidase. If fewer iron molecules are being prioritized for creating this enzyme, then less oxygen will be reduced at a time. The rest of the Krebs cycle can be in an optimal state but the cycle can only go as fast as the electron transport chain will allow it. I imagine that given a deficiency, the human body will prioritize iron formation in the blood over creating new cytochrome C oxidase since transporting oxygen to cells is more important than running the Krebs cycle at full speed.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31968114)
