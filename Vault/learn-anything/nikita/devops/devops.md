# DevOps

I think [Railway](https://railway.app/) is amazing example of doing Devops right. [Porter](https://github.com/getporter/porter), [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) & [Gaia](https://github.com/gaia-pipeline/gaia) are nice too.

[Google SRE Book](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) is great. [Airplane](https://www.airplane.dev/) is nice for exposing common commands for all in team to use.

[Devbox](https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox) is nice for bootstrapping environments.

It's interesting seeing how much internal infrastructure [Google](https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg) and [FB](https://github.com/greko6/xfb2xfb) uses.
