# Future

## ~ 2030

- Animals get proper rights and are [no longer forced to endure life in slaughterhouses and be eaten](../environment/veganism.md). No animal can be harmed for food, especially at industrial scale. Being vegan is normal. Caring is normal.
- Renewable & [environmentally friendly energy](../environment/index.md) sources fully replace fossil fuel use. Each country's grid is ran off renewable clean energy. Extreme carbon tax is implemented.
- All [vehicles are electrical](../travel/transportation/index.md). [Autonomous driving](../machine-learning/autonomous-driving.md) fully realized.
- Cure for all [cancers](../medicine/diseases/cancer.md) & [diseases](../medicine/diseases/index.md) (cheap [immunotherapies](../biology/immunology/immunotherapy.md), [medicine](../medicine/index.md), can [regenerate any tissue/organ](../biology/regenerative-medicine.md) you need).
- [Psychedelics](../drugs/psychedelics/index.md) legalized. Possession, purchase and manufacturing. Psychotherapy is available everywhere.
- [NLP](../nlp/index.md) lets machines understand [knowledge](../knowledge/index.md) & [language](../languages/index.md) at deep level.
- Universal [basic income](../economy/basic-income.md) allows each person to [work on problems](../research/solving-problems.md) they deeply care about. Novel [ideas](../ideas/index.md) can be explored by each person according to their interest & skill.
- [Learn Anything](../ideas/learn-anything.md) is one of the top tools for learning and finding ideas. [AI](../machine-learning/artificial-intelligence.md) is able to craft personally optimized [learning paths](../education/learning.md) & [connecting people](../relationships/index.md) to interesting novel ideas.
- Desktop apps built on web tech, use [Tauri](../programming-languages/rust/rust-libraries/tauri.md), not [Electron](../web/electron.md). All apps should run on most optimial speeds and use optimal amount of resources. No shipping a whole renderer just to render a page. Use the [OS](../operating-systems/index.md).
- No more [UX](../design/user-experience.md) dark patterns. Each app/tool experience optimizes for [user joy](../life/happiness.md) & empowerment.
- Ability to [control computers with thoughts at high bandwidth](../neuroscience/brain-computer-interfaces.md).
- Smarter [cities](../travel/cities.md) that are friendly to humans & [wildlife](../animals/index.md), not cars.
- A lot of designated areas across the globe given back to wildlife to flourish.
- No dictators ([China](../travel/visited/china.md)/[Russia](../travel/visited/russia.md)/..). Every country has proper [democratic](../governance/index.md) process with fairly elected leaders. Countries/cities compete for best talent & do best by their citizens.
- There are efficient tools to grow [food](../health/nutrition/foods.md) at home so more people can live off the grid without government intervention and need to pay tax.
- Government conducts itself in transparent and open manner. Any change to constitution or law is done in the [open](../open-source/index.md). Every tax dollar should be accounted for without ability to mismanage the budget (no stealing).

I try to get to this future as soon as possible by setting and completing my own personal [life goals](../focusing/goals.md).

[Hopeful Pathway for Humanity](https://hopefulpathway.blainehansen.me/) is great too as are the many links below.

## Notes

- [The primary ingredient for progress is optimism. The unwavering belief that something can be better is what drives the human race forward.](https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/1461705827560136707)
- [The idea that the future is hopeless is a bad meme that can bring down civilizations.](https://twitter.com/isabelleboemeke/status/1469059371363549184)
- [Today's culture is just in general more driven by fear of dystopia rather than excitement about positive visions, and so everyone's first question is now "will your thing create a dystopia?". If true, I think this is unhealthy and we should just fight it head-on.](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1532151214586048512)
