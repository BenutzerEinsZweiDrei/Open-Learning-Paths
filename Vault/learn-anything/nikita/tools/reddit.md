# [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

[Apollo iOS Reddit app](https://apolloapp.io/) is amazing iOS app. [Map of Reddit](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/) is fun to explore.

[Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) is a nice OSS federated alternative to Reddit. Tech wise at least.

With way [Reddit CEO conducted the AMA](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36277814) and their decision of profits above anything made me move to [Lemmy](../social-networks/lemmy.md). It just needs [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) level iOS and web app now.
