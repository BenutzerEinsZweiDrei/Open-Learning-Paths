# [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)

Love VitePress and use it for all my [docs](../programming/documentation.md) including [this very wiki](../other/wiki-workflow.md).

Perhaps in future, it'd be interesting to explore having a version of VitePress that allowed the use of [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) components instead or in addition to [Vue](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/vue/index.md).

But I had no real need for this thus far. VitePress design and especially custom themes is super clean and extensible.

## Examples

- [Iconify Design](https://iconify.design/) ([Code](https://github.com/iconify/website))

## Plugins

- [VitePress Sidebar](https://github.com/jooy2/vitepress-sidebar) - Automatically configures and manages the sidebar of your page with simple settings.
