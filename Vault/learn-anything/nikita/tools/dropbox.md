# [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)

I now use [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) to sync my files.

I used Dropbox previously to share and keep files on the cloud. Don't use it any more as I try to minimize unneccesary running processes on my macOS. 

I currently only use it for sharing some files to download for people although plan to write my own service for this with [Cloudflare Workers R2](../cloud-computing/serverless-computing/cloudflare-workers.md). I have a folder `Shares` and inside it is where I put various files that I want to publicly share with people. I then use a modified version of [Directory Watches workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?raw=true) to scan through this folder from Alfred. I then modified one of the actions so that on pressing `return` it gives me a shareable link of the file. Here is how that Alfred filter looks like for me:

It's pretty amazing as I can very easily query all the links I shared with anyone. I want to move this workflow to something I own myself.

For sharing files temporarily I use [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) and [Vitor's awesome Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5233-uploadfile-%E2%80%94-upload-files-and-directories-for-easy-sharing/) for it.

I also used Dropbox for sharing configuration of some apps like [Alfred](../macOS/apps/alfred/index.md).
