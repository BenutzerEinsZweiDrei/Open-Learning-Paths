# [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

Evaluating using Raycast as my main plugin interface. Currently use [Alfred](../macOS/apps/alfred/index.md) & [Script Kit](../macOS/apps/scriptkit.md) more.

[SOL](https://github.com/ospfranco/sol) & [Verve](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/verve) seem neat too.

[Raycast Extensions](https://github.com/raycast/extensions) has great code you can use for inspiration.

I teach how I use Raycast deeply in [my macOS automation course](https://macos.nikiv.dev).
