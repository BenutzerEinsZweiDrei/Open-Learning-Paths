# Journaling

Journaling my thoughts and experiences has been my most impactful and healthy habit I started doing in life.

I try to be radically open about how I feel and where I stand in life. What worries I have. Why I have them? What I can do? What happened in my life I am grateful for. The act of writing it all down is so cathartic.

I try to share these journal entries freely with all in my [look backs](../looking-back/index.md). It's hard to show vulnerability for all to see but in some ways its freeing too and it's been getting easier to do as I do more of them.

I use [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) for my private entries. Usually talking about my family, my love life or any truly private events I want to discuss and talk about there. Nothing beats a private journal in helping you sort your life out.

I started with journaling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32) on [cube calendar](https://www.thecubecalendar.com/en/news) I got from my girlfriend. The little space on the card had just enough space to write something memorable that happened to me during the day. It was lovely.

If I ever feel down, I can just start writing and let go of all these negative thoughts. It also serves as a snapshot in time of how I felt. Many times, the simple act of writing makes you realize that these things I worry about are silly and are either not in my control or simply not worth even [being sad](../health/depression.md) over. It also acts as evidence that I have changed as a person. And that's truly empowering and motivating me to keep going to get better every day.

I love reading these journals:
