# [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

I use [Tauri](../programming-languages/rust/rust-libraries/tauri.md) currently to build desktop apps. Tauri wraps over [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) web UI.

[Wails](../programming-languages/go/go-libraries/wails.md) is great too if you like [Go](../programming-languages/go/index.md).

I try to minimize amount of Electron apps I run on my mac as I find them wasteful in how they bundle entire chrome JS engine with every app. Hopefully soon, I won't be running any more Electron apps on my computer.

I also use [SwiftUI](../programming-languages/swift/swift-libraries/swiftui.md) to build certain native windows when tauri/web stack is not enough.

[osx-sign](https://github.com/electron/osx-sign) is nice for code signing the app.

## OSS apps

- [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) - Budgeting app. Local first architecture.
- [Twizzle](https://github.com/kitze/twizzle) - Desktop app for Twitter DM & composing tweets from the menubar.
- [HTTP Toolkit Desktop](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-desktop)

## Nice templates

- [Electron Vite](https://github.com/alex8088/electron-vite)

- [Electron Esbuild](https://github.com/Kiyozz/electron-esbuild)

## Notes

- [Simplest way to add auto-updating to Electron app is to create an empty public GitHub repo, and use update-electron-app. Publish new builds with GitHub releases.](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1469182489180708865)
