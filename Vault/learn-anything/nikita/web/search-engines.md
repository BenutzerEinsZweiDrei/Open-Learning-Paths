# Search engines

Use [Fuse](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) on web clients for fuzzy searching.

[Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch) is neat together with their [tokenizer lib](https://github.com/meilisearch/charabia) they use. More practically [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) or [Liqe](https://github.com/gajus/liqe) are great for plug and use solution.

[Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy), [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/), [Edgesearch](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/edgesearch) & [bloop](https://github.com/BloopAI/bloop) are interesting too.

Use [Lyra](https://github.com/nearform/lyra) or [Liqe](https://github.com/gajus/liqe) for doing browser side searches. [classes.wtf](https://github.com/ekzhang/classes.wtf) is great implementation of fast search. [Fuse](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) is interesting for fuzzy searches.

[Spyglass](https://github.com/a5huynh/spyglass) is nice too for crawling & indexing various web services.

[SEAL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SEAL) is interesting way to build search engines using [language models](../nlp/index.md).

Want to build my own version of [Monocle](https://github.com/thesephist/monocle) to search over my data.

[Search Engine in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm5xOJiVEeg) is nice watch.

Want to build an app [like this](https://twitter.com/ronithhh/status/1634278433168711680) or [RewindAI](https://twitter.com/RewindAI) but [open source](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1634373248270884868).

## Notes

- [If you’re implementing search please understand that using quotes means “find this literal text”.](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1574138778129944576)
- [10 years from now, google search will be a fraction of what it is today. it will only be used for objective search (e.g. medical advice, how to fix a flat tire, finding the best plumber). All subjective search will be done on social platforms with hyper-personalized algorithms.](https://twitter.com/elizalian/status/1574198894220541953)
