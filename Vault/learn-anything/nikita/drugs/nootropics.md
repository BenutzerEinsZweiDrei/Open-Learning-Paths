# [Nootropics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic)

[Sleep](../sleep/index.md), [exercise](../fitness/index.md) & and proper [nutrition](../health/nutrition/index.md) are the most important things you can do for ultimate mental performance combined with focused [mindfulness](../mindfulness/index.md).

I try to get most needed nutrients from healthy [food](../health/nutrition/foods.md) but I also take few important [supplements](../health/nutrition/supplements.md) for extra things that are hard to come by with my diet.

There are also [few nootropics you can take that in some way boost your mental ability and focus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ub5i2d/what_is_the_most_interesting_nootropic_or_most/). Some infrequent doses of [psychedelics](psychedelics/psychedelics.md) fall into this category for me.
