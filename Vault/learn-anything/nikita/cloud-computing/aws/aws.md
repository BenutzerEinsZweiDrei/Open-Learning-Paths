# [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

AWS has a [nice free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), [Digger](https://digger.dev/) & [ts2asl](https://github.com/Stedi/ts2asl) are nice. [SLIC Starter](https://github.com/fourTheorem/slic-starter) seems great as AWS serverless starter.

Haven't used AWS much but did use [GCP](../gcp/gcp.md) which is similar. One thing I learned is that settting up billing alerts is a must have so as to not overpay for compute. Also ideally you use services you truly need from these cloud providers, because the pricing does get a bit crazy at times.

[SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/sst) seems like useful framework. [Pulumi AWS](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx) is nice too.
