# [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)

Use [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) with [Superflare](https://github.com/jplhomer/superflare) to build most of my [APIs](../../api/index.md).

[Cloudflare stack](https://twitter.com/pbteja1998/status/1496147994533679105) is quite [extensive](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest).

[Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), [Miniflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare), [Worktop](https://github.com/lukeed/worktop), [Workers Go lib](https://github.com/syumai/workers) (with [template](https://github.com/syumai/worker-template-go)) seem useful.

Trying to build very fast web apps and sites with [Solid](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md), [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono), [D1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31339299) together with [Grafbase](../../networking/graphql/grafbase.md) or replicated [SQLite](../../databases/sqlite.md) with [Turso](https://chiselstrike.com/) as more permanent storage with smart caching and [architecture](../../programming/software-architecture/index.md).

[Wildebeest](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest) is nice demo of using Cloudflare tech for everything.

## Notes

- [Think of Durable Objects as in memory cache in JavaScript spread across all edges globally with two specialties: 1. It’s automatically scaled and persisted to durable storage after workers finish execution. 2. It’s single threaded globally so you effectively get a write lock on them. The object actually only runs in one single location. And then based on the requests coming to it, Cloudflare moves it around to the most optimum location.](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha/status/1460511611756728323)
