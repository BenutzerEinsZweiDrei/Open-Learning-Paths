# Game development

[3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/) is great. [Nano](https://github.com/lonng/nano) is great for building networked game servers.

[Tangle](https://github.com/kettle11/tangle) is interesting.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72y2EC5fkcE) is a must watch for the kind of incremental development style you can have.

## Notes

- Programming is about solving problems. Programming a game isn't really any different. I start by thinking what problem is this game going to solve, as well as what other games might already do that. For example if I was making a physics puzzle game I would also consider "Why aren't they just playing Portal instead of this?" And go from there.
- ["Mod" culture in gaming is an incredibly powerful, creative force that is responsible for nearly all popular games today. It allows non-technical users to tinker, create, and distribute to an engaged, pre-installed user base.](https://twitter.com/cpaik/status/1270824271204532226)
- [To anyone who struggles with large-scale nature scenes. Test out the idea you have on a small square first, get all the elements to work together, and then build your scene from there. ](https://twitter.com/BlenderBrit/status/1386689708131033095)
- [Adding randomness to a game can be a way to give it that property of "easy to learn, hard to master", and in turn make it easier for a community to grow around the game. When you add randomness, it becomes possible for novices to sometimes beat more experienced players through sheer luck. Contrast that with e.g. chess, where it doesn't take much skill difference before the most skilled player is almost certain to win. So randomness makes it easier for newcomers to get the occasional win, to keep them motivated while learning. But at the same time, randomness can make it harder to master, because the cause-effect-relationship between good decisions and good outcomes becomes blurred.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31593995)
