# Games

I keep a list of [games I want to play](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/12652-wish-list/?num=25) & [games I am playing now](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/12651-playing/?num=25) or [plan to play next](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/513443-next/?num=25) on [Grouvee](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/).

I also keep a list of [all games I have played](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/12649-played/?num=25) with a [list of my favorite games](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/shelves/53363-favorite/?num=25) I've played. I also [share thoughts on some games I played](https://www.grouvee.com/user/nikivi/reviews/).

I mostly only play [PS5](playstation.md) games. Together with [chess](chess.md) on iPhone/iPad.

One game I thought of making is extending [Veloren](https://github.com/veloren/veloren) to make my own version of [Hytale](https://hytale.com/)/[Minecraft](minecraft.md). Bottleneck there is making pretty assets but [generative models](../machine-learning/generative-machine-learning.md) are getting better and better. And can even generate [Blender](../design/blender.md) models now.

If I ever make a small game, [itch.io](https://itch.io/) seems like a nice marketplace.

I wish someone built a nice UI/UX gaming track site like [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/). [Grouvee](https://www.grouvee.com/) is closest I found that lets you share lists and things on the web but has bad UI. [GameTrack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740) has nicer UX and mobile app but no website and ability to share things. Perhaps one built this already.
