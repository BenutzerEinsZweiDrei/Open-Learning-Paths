# Veganism

I think it's [mind numbing how animals can be treated by people](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlyterrifying/comments/10ajila/baby_chicks_in_shackled_to_this_machine/). And how oblivious most people are to it all [either mindfully or simply due to not being aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/spje9b/just_watched_dominion_documentary_as_a_regular/) of the [consequences of their decisions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/comments/10ie7f2/insane_reality_of_maple_lodge_farms_a_self/). Like buying some dead animal's meat have.

Watching [Earthlings](https://letterboxd.com/film/earthlings/) made me go [pescatarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism) instantly after watching. I limit number of fish I eat too. Think Earthlings or [Dominion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny6aqdFy9SI) should be a mandatory watch for everyone. As it should be enough to at least make you reconsider what food you eat. Thankfully whole food plant based diet is [genuinely a healthier diet](../health/nutrition/index.md) too and there's so many fruits, vegetables and beans that you can choose to eat whilst making it tasty too. I often [love eating blueberries, avocados, walnuts and almonds](../health/nutrition/foods.md) together with making [delicious smoothies](../health/nutrition/supplements.md). I also love making various [recipes](../health/nutrition/recipes.md) and generally love exploring non meat or [dairy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/116mlv7/comment/j98dgyq/?context=3) cuisine around the globe as I travel.

I hope [more people wake up to this issue and it changes soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW6AgWPWRP4). Because animals should not be treated like that and [especially at such scales](https://twitter.com/peterwildeford/status/1520984767549878273). It's sad.

I personally believe the idea of [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation), only your memory does get wiped after you [die](../life/death.md). Existence never stops though and you will continue to exist as some other conscious being. And I truly want to minimize my chances of being born into a pig that lives it's entire life in a slaughterhouse, just counting its days until the end.

That's why it's so essential everyone acts nicely to each other. Because in some way, everyone is [actually you too](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html). To me this is the most plausible scenario of what happens when you die.

## Notes

- [If everyone in the world went to mostly plant-based (like the Okinawan traditional diet), it would be a MUCH better world. The positive impact would be huge. The impact on your health of having animal products only on special occasions would be minimal. I will tell you though, I've done that and when I've had beef after a long vegan run, it makes me sick to my stomach and I'm certain it's not merely psychological.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8x3tfm/is_100_vegan_the_way_to_go/)

- [Veganism should be the moral baseline. If you can live without animals being directly killed or exploited, why wouldn’t you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8x3tfm/is_100_vegan_the_way_to_go/)
- [The vegan diet, and veganism in general, is a plant-based diet, and an avoidance of all commodities made from animal products. Its focus is on cruelty to animals. WFPB is another plant-based diet, but with stricter recommendations, that you eat the healthiest of foods, and avoid processed and animal derived foods. I am vegan because I believe cruelty to the animals should be avoided, and I adhere to WFPB because I want to promote my health. Two different motivations that produce similar results with a lot of overlap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/82lw2d/whats_the_difference_between_a_plantbased_and_a/)
- [Most consumers don't even know what conditions are like for dairy animals. In Europe, consumers smugly assume we have high welfare standards (maybe we do relative to other countries), but I was shocked to learned that some farms still tie and tether cows in small cramped indoor spaces. In fact, most dairy cows will spend the majority of their life indoors rather than outside grazing on pasture. This is the price of cheap, industrial-scale agriculture.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24091202)
- [I think these are attacks by a population that's starving to death, surrounded by deafening noise (and remember, their primary sense is hearing) and poisoned by heavy metals accumulating in the food chain. I think they understand that humans and boats are responsible for the stress they're experiencing, and are attacking smaller boats that they think they can sink in desperation or anger.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24460126)
- [Cows only give milk after they’ve given birth. They would only produce about a gallon a day if they were feeding their calf, and only for one year. Industrial dairy production requires a bit more: Cows are bred to produce 7x normal milk. Cows are artificially impregnated, have a calf, calf is taken away, three months later they are impregnated again, and again. After three years or so of having calves and producing unnatural amounts of milk, their milk production drops from the average high of 7.5 gallons. They are then shipped off to be culled for beef. Cows are treated like milk producing machines. They are tied up, fed and milked. I imagine having their calf taken away must be traumatic for both. The more I thought about it the more it saddened me. I used to love milk. Now I have yogurt or cheese a couple of times a month but no straight milk. I think if I lived on a farm and knew the cow was humanely treated I wouldn’t mind having a little milk for coffee or baking. But that’s probably it. Also, knowing the terrible toll animal agriculture is taking on the environment is sort of the final straw.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/116mlv7/for_those_who_switched_from_drinking_cows_milk_to/)
