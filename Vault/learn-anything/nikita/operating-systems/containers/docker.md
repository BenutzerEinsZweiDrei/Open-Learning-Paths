# [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

[Using Nix with Dockerfiles](https://mitchellh.com/writing/nix-with-dockerfiles) is great read. Can also use [devenv](https://devenv.sh/containers/).

The nice thing about using Nix to build Docker images is that [image contains literally only the dependencies of the app](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1649502503745261568).

[DockerSlim](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim) is useful. Seems everyone is moving to [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) now.

Try to [avoid using Docker](https://twitter.com/iansu/status/1555255026666258432) for [Nix](../../package-managers/nix/index.md) which can even [build Docker images](https://lobste.rs/s/ilgax7/use_flake_nix_not_dockerfile) if you need them.

I use [GitHub container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store docker containers.

[dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) is neat tool explore contents of each image.

[MRSK](https://github.com/mrsked/mrsk) is interesting tool to deploy containers on bare [Linux](../linux/linux.md) machines like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).
