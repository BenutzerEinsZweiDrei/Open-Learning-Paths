# [Zero knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)

[RISC Zero](https://github.com/risc0/risc0) looks neat. [Zero Knowledge on Ramp](https://github.com/SupremeSingh/Awesome-ZK) & [Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf) are nice intros.

[Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir) is nice DSL. [Fusion zkRollup](https://github.com/leonardoalt/fusion) is interesting.
