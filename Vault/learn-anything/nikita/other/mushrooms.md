# Mushrooms

[Mycelium](https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/mycelium/) is [fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm1FgFFzQd4).

I personally love [psilocybin mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom) and take them [occasionally](../drugs/psychedelics/index.md). I also try take some mushrooms daily as part of my [supplement](../health/nutrition/supplements.md).

Get my spores to grow [here](https://orangutantradingco.com/). Grow them using [Grow Kit](https://mycopunks.com/products/beginner-fruit-in-the-bag-mushroom-grow-kit).

Using [this guide](https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/24420178).

[Uncle Ben Tek](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/dbzy8e/uncle_ben_tek_aka_spiderman_tek_full_instructions/) combined with [this method](https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/25274461/fpart/all/vc/1) is nice too.

[Mushroom Growers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MushroomGrowers/) & [90 Second Mycology](https://www.youtube.com/@90SecondMycology) are great to study.

[Wholecelium](https://www.wholecelium.com/) is nice shop to buy [psilocybin truffles](https://www.wholecelium.com/product-category/magic-truffles/). [Druid](https://www.wholecelium.com/shop/magic-truffles/psilocybe-druid/) are my favorites.

I like to eat truffles/mushrooms mixed with Greek Yogurt & blueberries. I also dislike eating on empty stomach and prefer to eat a light breakfast beforehand, usually my daily omelette and salad with tomatoes/avocado and feta cheese.

## Growing steps

### With grow kit

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CczWloHO__Y) is great.

1. Open grow kit box. Put water in the box. Close the box and put it in either fridge or room. Wait ~ 12h.
2. After 12h. Remove the water from the box. Put the box in the bag (without the lid). Close the bag with paperclips.

- Make sure that it doesn't soak for more than 18 hours cause the mycelium can drown if it's soaked for too long.

### Without grow kit (own substrate)

If no grow kit, method is similar but you need to create your own substrate for mushrooms to grow in.

## Notes

- [We think of mushrooms as being "the fungus" but really a mushroom is just a temporary structure that the fungus, which a network of hyphae buried in the substrate, builds to disperse its spores. They're like a protrusion from an unseen world into ours.](https://twitter.com/NotBrunoAgain/status/1520055622997270534)
- Well worth getting a pressure cooker and getting into making own substrate/grain for mushrooms. Check out ['Easy As Fuk tek'](https://www.shroomery.org/13986/Simplified-Cultivation-Methods-Easy-As-Fuck-link-list-Trusted-Culvator-links-and-methods-and-other-cultivation-info) for an easy starter.
- [Major reported side effect of psilocybin mushrooms is “loss of fear of death”, a feeling of universal love and comfort with the cycle of life. Mushroom is telling you this. The thing that eats you when you die. You’re being gaslit.](https://twitter.com/0xalaric/status/1648682286659796992)
