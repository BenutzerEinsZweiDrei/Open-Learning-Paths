# Movies

I keep a list of movies [I've seen](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/by/date/) and [liked](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/by/your-rating/) on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/).

I have a [Watchlist of movies I want to watch](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/watchlist/) & I [share thoughts on some movies I saw](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/reviews/by/added/).

And here are some [lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/lists/), [films](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/films/) and [reviews](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/likes/reviews/) I liked.

I try to review/rank a movie/series/game first thing after consuming the content without seeing what others scored it on as that makes my score not truly honest. I try to rank things based firstly on my enjoyment of the content and only after, the actual quality of the acting/cinematography and the rest.

[In Bruges](https://letterboxd.com/film/in-bruges/) is one my most favorite movies I saw. Would love to write a script for something [this good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQolQHtvqjw) played by such great actors.
