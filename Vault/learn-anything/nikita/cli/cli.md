# Command Line Tools

[cheat.sh](http://cheat.sh/) & [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg) are useful tools. [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/) are great.

[nap](https://github.com/maaslalani/nap) & [circumflex](https://github.com/bensadeh/circumflex) are nicely made CLIs written in [Go](../programming-languages/go/index.md) & [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (my preferred CLI stack).

There is also a [nice curated CLI list](https://github.com/learn-anything/command-line-tools)

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is [great tool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35248098).

## Use

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to search for text.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to fuzzy search through inputs.
- [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to rerun command when files of certain type change. Essential for fast feedback workflows. I usually have code on the left and terminal on right in [VSCode](../text-editors/vs-code/index.md). Use some [fish functions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/fish/functions.fish#L20) for common commands.
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) to replace ls as it has prettier output.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to show contents of the file.
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) to process/modify JSON.
- [git](../programming/version-control/git.md) for all version control.
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) to do HTTP requests in terminal.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download videos.
