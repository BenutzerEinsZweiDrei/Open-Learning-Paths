# Interactive computing

[Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com/) are amazing for playing with data & visualizing it nicely.

[Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwXt90ZqA) & [Simply Make Interactive Diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT9Xu-ctNqI) are great talks.
