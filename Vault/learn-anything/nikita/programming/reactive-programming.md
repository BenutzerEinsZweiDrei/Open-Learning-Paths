# [Reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming)

[Super Charging Fine-Grained Reactive Performance](https://dev.to/modderme123/super-charging-fine-grained-reactive-performance-47ph) & [Hands-on Introduction to Fine-Grained Reactivity](https://dev.to/ryansolid/a-hands-on-introduction-to-fine-grained-reactivity-3ndf) are great reads.

Love [Solid](../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md)'s reactivity model. [Voby](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) & [Signia](https://github.com/tldraw/signia) interesting too.

[Rust Signals](https://github.com/Pauan/rust-signals) library is interesting.

## Notes

- [Event streams (like plain observables) emits values. Signals (and behavior subjects) have values. Queues (channels and some buffered and published observables) hold/store values. For example seminal paper on functional reactive programming defines two primitives- event streams and behaviors. They have different laws and this different capabilities. Queues are even more powerful but provide less guarantees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/yk6iy3/react_vdom_vs_preact_signal_performance_flame/)
- [Signals are not just about 'optimizing performance'. They do for ordinary data what React only does for DOM trees: provide a composable, consistent, managed way to derive it from your root application state, and to respond to changes over time.](https://twitter.com/djsheldrick/status/1629036972944633856)
