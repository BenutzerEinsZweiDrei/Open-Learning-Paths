The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable (2002) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary/<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756?tag=learnawesome-21<br><br>

A First-Rate Madness<br>This New York Times bestseller is a myth-shattering exploration of the powerful connections between mental illness and leadership.Historians have long puzzled over the apparent mental instability of great and terrible leaders alike: Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, Hitler, and others. In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Programme at Tufts Medical Center, offers and sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disorders also make for the best leaders in times of crisis.From the importance of Lincoln's "depressive realism" to the lacklustre leadership of exceedingly sane men as Neville Chamberlain, A First-Rate Madness overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357675-a-first-rate-madness<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-first-rate-madness-summary/<br><br>
A Year With Peter Drucker<br>A year-long leadership development course, divided into short, weekly lessons, based on Peter Drucker's personal coaching program, previously unpublished material, and selected readings from the management guru's classic works, compiled by his longtime collaborator Joseph A. Maciariello.A Year with Peter Drucker distills the essence of Peter Drucker's personal mentorship program into an easy-to-follow 52-week course, exploring the themes Drucker felt were most important to leadership development, including:Leaders Must Set Sights on the Important and not the Urgentâa key differentiator between a subordinate and a chief. Management is a Human ActivityâProcess must serve people, in and out of the organization. The Roadmap to Personal Effectivenessâthe importance of mission and doing the Right Things not just Getting Things Done. The critical importance of leadership succession especially at top ranks of the organization.Each weekly management meditation includes a lesson and a message or anecdote taken from Drucker's extensive body of work, as well as suggestions for further reading, reflective questions, and quick, easy prompts to help readers incorporate the knowledge they've learned into their daily work.A lifetime of wisdom brilliantly honed into a single essential volume by Drucker's collaborator Joseph A. Maciariello, A Year with Peter Drucker gives both lifelong Drucker fans and young executives now discovering his brilliance an invaluable opportunity to learn directly from the late master.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663099-a-year-with-peter-drucker<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-year-with-peter-drucker-summary/<br><br>

Executive Presence<br>Are you "leadership material?" More importantly, do others perceive you to be? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a noted expert on workplace power and influence, shows you how to identify and embody the Executive Presence (EP) that you need to succeed. You can have the experience and qualifications of a leader, but without executive presence, you won't advance. EP is an amalgam of qualities that true leaders exude, a presence that telegraphs you're in charge or deserve to be. Articulating those qualities isn't easy, however. Based on a nationwide survey of college graduates working across a range of sectors and occupations, Sylvia Hewlett and the Center for Talent Innovation discovered that EP is a dynamic, cohesive mix of appearance, communication, and gravitas. While these elements are not equal, to have true EP, you must know how to use all of them to your advantage. Filled with eye-opening insights, analysis, and practical advice for both men and women, mixed with illustrative examples from executives learning to use the EP, Executive Presence will help you make the leap from working like an executive to feeling like an executive.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Executive-Presence-Missing-Between-Success/dp/0062246895?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/executive-presence-summary/<br><br>

Leaders Eat Last<br>The New York TimesÂ bestselling follow-up to Simon Sinek's global hitÂ Start With WhyWhy do only a few peopleÂ get to say âI love my jobâ?Â It seems unfair that finding fulfillment atÂ work is like winning a lottery; that only aÂ few lucky ones get to feel valued by theirÂ organizations, to feel like they belong.Imagine a world where almost everyone wakesÂ up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valuedÂ during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled.This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, inÂ many successful organizations, great leaders areÂ creating environments in which people naturallyÂ work together to do remarkable things.Â In his travels around the world since the publicationÂ of his bestsellerÂ Start with Why, Simon SinekÂ noticed that some teams were able to trust each otherÂ so deeply that they would literally put their lives onÂ the line for each other. Other teams, no matter whatÂ incentives were offered, were doomed to infighting,Â fragmentation and failure. Why?The answer became clear during a conversationÂ with a Marine Corps general.Â âOfficers eat last,â he said.Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ateÂ first while the most senior Marines took their placeÂ at the back of the line. Whatâs symbolic in the chowÂ hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: great leadersÂ sacrifice their own comfortâeven their own survivalâfor the good of those in their care.This principle has been true since the earliestÂ tribes of hunters and gatherers. Itâs not a managementÂ theory; itâs biology. Our brains and bodies evolvedÂ to help us find food, shelter, mates and especiallyÂ safety. Weâve always lived in a dangerous world,Â facing predators and enemies at every turn. WeÂ thrived only when we felt safe among our group.Our biology hasnât changed in fifty thousandÂ years, but our environment certainly has. TodayâsÂ workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoiaÂ and self-interest. But the best organizations fosterÂ trust and cooperation because their leaders buildÂ what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety that separates theÂ security inside the team from the challenges outside.The Circle of Safety leads to stable, adaptive,Â confident teams, where everyone feels they belongÂ and all energies are devoted to facing the commonÂ enemy and seizing big opportunities.Â As he did inÂ Start with Why, Sinek illustratesÂ his ideas with fascinating true stories from a wideÂ range of examples, from the military to manufacturing,Â from government to investment banking.The biology is clear: when it matters most, leadersÂ who are willing to eat last are rewarded withÂ deeply loyal colleagues who will stop at nothing to advance their leaderâs vision and their organizationâsÂ interests. Itâs amazing how well it works.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Together-Others/dp/1543614620?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/leaders-eat-last-summary/<br><br>

Move Your Bus<br>New York Times bestselling author and award-winning educator Ron Clark applies his successful leadership principles to the business world in this effective and accessible guidebook, perfect for any manager looking to inspire and motivate his or her team. Includes a foreword by bestselling author and FranklinCovey executive Sean Covey.Teamwork is crucial to the success of any business, and as acclaimed author and speaker Ron Clark illustrates, the members of any team are the key to unlocking success. Imagine a company as a bus filled with people who either help or hinder a team's ability to move it forward: drivers (who steer the organization), runners (who consistently go above and beyond for the good of the organization), joggers (who do their jobs without pushing themselves), walkers (who are just getting pulled along), and riders (who hinder success and drag the team down). It's the team leader's job to recognize how members fall into these categories, encourage them to keep the "bus" moving by working together, and know when it's time to kick the riders off.In the tradition of Who Moved My Cheese? and Fish!, Move Your Bus is an accessible and uplifting business parable that illustrates Clark's expert strategies to maximize the performance of each member of a team. These easy to implement techniques will inspire employees and team leaders alike to work harder and smarter and drive the organization to succeed.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492545-move-your-bus<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/move-your-bus-summary/<br><br>

Rookie Smarts<br>Wall Street JournalÂ BestsellerIs it possible to be at your best even when you are underqualified or doing something for the first time? Is it still possible, even after decades of experience, to recapture the enthusiasm, curiosity, and fearlessness of youth to take on new challenges? With the right mindsetâwith Rookie Smartsâyou can.In a rapidly changing world, experience can be a curse. Careers stall, innovation stops, and strategies grow stale. Being new, naÃ¯ve, and even clueless can be an asset. For todayâs knowledge workers, constant learning is more valuable than mastery.In this essential guide, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explains how to reclaim and cultivate this curious, flexible, youthful mindset calledÂ Rookie Smarts. She argues that the most successful rookies are hunter-gatherersâalert and seeking, cautious but quick like firewalkers, and hungry and relentless like pioneers. Most importantly, she identifies a breed of leaders she refers to as âperpetual rookies.â Despite years of experience, they retain their rookie smarts, thinking and operating with the mindsets and practices of these high-performing rookies.Rookie SmartsÂ addresses the questions every experienced professional faces: âWill my knowledge and skills become obsolete and irrelevant? Will a young, inexperienced newcomer upend my company or me? How can I keep up?â The answer is to stay fresh, keep learning, and know when to think like a rookie.Rookie SmartsÂ isnât just for professionals seeking personal renewal; it is an indispensible resource for all leaders who must ensure their workforces remains vital and competitive.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663101-rookie-smarts<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rookie-smarts-summary/<br><br>

But three things have changed the path to success:Boomers are realizing that a lot of the things they were promised aren't going to materialize, and they have started second and third careers.Technology has given access to an unprecedented number of people who are building online empires and changing their lives in ways that would have been impossible years ago.The days of "success first, significance later," have ended.While none of the stages can be skipped, they can be shortened and accelerated. There are only two paths in life: average and awesome. The average path is easy because all you have to do is nothing. The awesome path is more challenging, because things like fear only bother you when you do work that matters. The good news is "Start" gives readers practical, actionable insights to be more awesome, more often.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters/dp/1937077594?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/start-summary/<br><br>

Tens of millions of people in business, government, and schools have dramatically improved their lives and organizations by applying the principles of Stephen R.

The Speed Of Trust<br>Over two million copies sold.Stephen M. R. Covey shows how trustâand the speed at which it is established with clients, employees, and all stakeholdersâis the single most critical component of a successful leader and organization.Stephen M. R. Covey, widely known as one of the worldâs leading authorities on trust, asserts that it is âthe most overlooked, misunderstood, underutilized asset to enable performance. Its impact, for good or bad, is dramatic and pervasive. Itâs something you canât escape.â Thankfully, itâs is also the thing that can dramatically improve your personal and professional success.Why trust? The simple, often overlooked fact is this: work gets done with and through people. The Speed of Trust offers an unprecedented and eminently practical look at exactly how trust functions in every transaction and every relationshipâfrom the most personal to the broadest, most indirect interaction. It specifically demonstrates how to establish trust intentionally so that you and your organization can forego the time-killing, bureaucratic check-and-balance processes that is so often deployed in lieu of actual trust.This 2018 updated edition includes an insightful afterword by the author which explores ten key reasons why trust is more relevant now than ever beforeâincluding how trust is the new currency of our world today.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076.The_Speed_of_Trust<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-speed-of-trust-summary/<br><br>

Tribes<br>A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It's our nature.Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they're enabling countless new tribes to be bornâgroups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming. And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?The Web can do amazing things, but it can't provide leadership. That still has to come from individualsâpeople just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.If you think leadership is for other people, think againâleaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a "sheepwalker"âsomeone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don't do very well these days.Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It's not easy, but it's easier than you think.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL16909900M/Tribes<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/tribes-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Tribes<br><br>

Theory U<br>Access the deepest source of inspiration and vision We live in a time of massive institutional failure that manifests in the form of three major divides: the ecological, the social, and the spiritual. Addressing these challenges requires a new consciousness and collective leadership capacity. In this groundbreaking book, Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways and in so doing discover a revolutionary approach to learning and leadership. In most large systems today, we collectively create results that no one wants. What keeps us stuck in such patterns of the past? It's our blind spot, that is, our lack of awareness of the inner place from which our attention and intention originate. By moving through Scharmer's U process, we consciously access the blind spot and learn to connect to our authentic Self--the deepest source of knowledge and inspiration. Theory U offers a rich diversity of compelling stories, examples, exercises, and practices that allow leaders, organizations, and larger systems to cosense and coshape the future that is wanting to emerge. This second edition features a new preface in which Scharmer identifies five transformational trends and describes U process case stories around the world. There are also eight color drawings by Kelvy Bird that capture U journey applications and illustrate the concepts in the book, as well as new resources for applying the principles and practices.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27427612M/Theory_U<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/theory-u-summary/<br><br>

Why We Work<br>An eye-opening, groundbreaking tour of the purpose of work in our lives, showing how work operates in our culture and how you can find your own path to happiness in the workplace.Why do we work? The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.Weâve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, weâve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through âmenialâ jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.How did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Work-Barry-Schwartz/dp/144237814X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-work-summary/<br><br>

His honest, be-the-best style of management became the gold standard in business, with his relentless focus on people, teamwork, and profits.Since Welch retired in 2001 as chairman and chief executive officer of GE, he has traveled the world, speaking to more than 250,000 people and answering their questions on dozens of wide-ranging topics.Inspired by his audiences and their hunger for straightforward guidance, Welch has written both a philosophical and pragmatic book, which is destined to become the bible of business for generations to come. It clearly lays out the answers to the most difficult questions people face both on and off the job.Welch's objective is to speak to people at every level of an organization, in companies large and small. His audience is everyone from line workers to MBAs, from project managers to senior executives. His goal is to help everyone who has a passion for success.Welch begins Winning with an introductory section called "Underneath It All," which describes his business philosophy. He explores the importance of values, candor, differentiation, and voice and dignity for all.The core of Winning is devoted to the real "stuff" of work. This main part of the book is split into three sections. The first looks inside the company, from leadership to picking winners to making change happen. The second section looks outside, at the competition, with chapters on strategy, mergers, and Six Sigma, to name just three. The next section of the book is about managing your careerâfrom finding the right job to achieving work-life balance.Welch's optimistic, no excuses, get-it-done mind-set is riveting. Packed with personal anecdotes and written in Jack's distinctive no b.s. voice, Winning offers deep insights, original thinking, and solutions to nuts-and-bolts problems that will change the way people think about work.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/866222.Winning<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/winning-summary/<br><br>
