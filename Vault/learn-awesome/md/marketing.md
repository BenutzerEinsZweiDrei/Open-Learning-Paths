Duct Tape Marketing<br>As a renowned marketing guru and small business coach, John Jantsch has become a leading advisor on how to build and grow a thriving business. In his trusted book for small businesses, he challenges readers to craft a marketing strategy that is as reliable as the go-to household item we all know, love, and turn to in a pinch: duct tape. Duct Tape Marketing shows readers how to develop and execute a marketing plan that yields more revenue and ensures the longevity of small businesses. Taking a strategic, systemic approach to marketing rather than being constantly won over to a âmarketing idea of the weekâ helps small business leaders establish a solid--âstickyâ--foundation of trust with their customers that only grows stronger with the application of more and more metaphorical tape. Youâll learn how to turn your marketing efforts into a lead generation machine and move far beyond your week-to-week strategizing to create long-term plans for your businessâs continual growth. Plus, the revised and updated edition of this industry-leading book includes all new tools, rules, and tactics that respond to the ways social media and digital developments have shifted and evolved the marketing landscape. Let's face it: as a small business owner, you are really in the business of marketing. This practical, actionable guide includes fresh ideas that stick where you put them--and stand the test of time.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27129802M/Duct_tape_marketing<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/duct-tape-marketing-summary/<br><br>

Permission Marketing<br>The man Business Week calls "the ultimate entrepreneur for the Information Age" explains "Permission Marketing"âthe groundbreaking concept that enables marketers to shape their message so that consumers will willingly accept it.Whether it is the TV commercial that breaks into our favorite program, or the telemarketing phone call that disrupts a family dinner, traditional advertising is based on the hope of snatching our attention away from whatever we are doing. Seth Godin calls this Interruption Marketing, and, as companies are discovering, it no longer works.  Instead of annoying potential customers by interrupting their most coveted commodityâtimeâPermission Marketing offers consumers incentives to accept advertising voluntarily. Now this Internet pioneer introduces a fundamentally different way of thinking about advertising products and services. By reaching out only to those individuals who have signaled an interest in learning more about a product, Permission Marketing enables companies to develop long-term relationships with customers, create trust, build brand awareness -- and greatly improve the chances of making a sale.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/permission-marketing-summary/<br><br>
Purple Cow - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>The acclaimed Wall Street Journal and Business Week Bestseller.You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place.

This Is Marketing<br>
  Real marketing isn't about racking up clicks and tweets; it's about connection, empathy, and making a difference.
Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from Permission Marketing to Purple Cow to Tribes to The Dip.Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labor.This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals.It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. THIS IS MARKETING offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26977632M/This_is_marketing<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/this-is-marketing-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/ThisIsMarketing<br><br>
