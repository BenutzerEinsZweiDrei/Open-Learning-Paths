Excellent Sheep<br>A groundbreaking manifesto for people searching for the kind of insight on leading, thinking, and living that elite schools should beâbut arenâtâproviding.As a professor at Yale, Bill Deresiewicz saw something that troubled him deeply. His students, some of the nationâs brightest minds, were adrift when it came to the big questions: how to think critically and creatively, and how to find a sense of purpose.Excellent Sheep takes a sharp look at the high-pressure conveyor belt that begins with parents and counselors who demand perfect grades and culminates in the skewed applications Deresiewicz saw firsthand as a member of Yaleâs admissions committee. As schools shift focus from the humanities to "practical" subjects like economics and computer science, students are losing the ability to think in innovative ways. Deresiewicz explains how college should be a time for self-discovery, when students can establish their own values and measures of success, so they can forge their own path. He addresses parents, students, educators, and anyone who's interested in the direction of American society, featuring quotes from real students and graduates he has corresponded with over the years, candidly exposing where the system is broken and clearly presenting solutions.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26886453M/Excellent_sheep<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/excellent-sheep-summary/<br><br>
Fire and Fury<br>#1 New York Times BestsellerWith extraordinary access to the West Wing, Michael Wolff reveals what happened behind-the-scenes in the first nine months of the most controversial presidency of our time in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the countryâand the worldâhas witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief.This riveting and explosive account of Trumpâs administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including:-- What President Trumpâs staff really thinks of him -- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama -- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired -- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trumpâs son-in-law Jared Kushner couldnât be in the same room -- Who is really directing the Trump administrationâs strategy in the wake of Bannonâs firing -- What the secret to communicating with Trump is -- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The ProducersNever before in history has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, Fire and Fury shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.âEssential reading.ââMichael DâAntonio, author of Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success, CNN.comâNot since Harry Potter has a new book caught fire in this wayâ¦[Fire and Fury] is indeed a significant achievement, which deserves much of the attention it has received.ââThe Economist<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27760045M/Fire_and_Fury<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/fire-and-fury-summary/<br><br>

On Liberty<br>John Stuart Mill was a prominent English philosopher and political economist in the 19th century. Mill is considered to be one of the most influential liberal thinkers in history and he was a significant contributor to many fields such as social theory, political theory, and political economy. Mill is also notable for being the first Member of Parliament to argue in favor of women's suffrage. On Liberty, published in 1859, is generally considered to be Mill's most famous work.

Smart People Should Build Things<br>Andrew Yang, the founder of Venture for America, offers a unique solution to our countryâs economic and social problemsâour smart people should be building things. Smart People Should Build Things offers a stark picture of the current culture and a revolutionary model that will redirect a generation of ambitious young people to the critical job of innovating and building new businesses.As the Founder and CEO of Venture for America, Andrew Yang places top college graduates in start-ups for two years in emerging U.S. cities to generate job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. He knows firsthand how our current view of education is broken. Many college graduates aspire to finance, consulting, law school, grad school, or medical school out of a vague desire for additional status and progress rather than from a genuine passion or fit.In Smart People Should Build Things, this self-described ârecovering lawyerâ and entrepreneur weaves together a compelling narrative of success stories (including his own), offering observations about the flow of talent in the United States and explanations of why current trends are leading to economic distress and cultural decline. He also presents recommendations for both policy makers and job seekers to make entrepreneurship more realistic and achievable.Â <br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Smart-People-Should-Build-Things/dp/0062292048?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/smart-people-should-build-things-summary/<br><br>
