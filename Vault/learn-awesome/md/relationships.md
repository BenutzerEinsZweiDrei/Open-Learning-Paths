Attached<br>We rely on science to tell us everything from what to eat to when and how long to exercise, but what about relationships? Is there a scientific explanation for why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle? According to psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, the answer is a resounding "yes."In Attached, Levine and Heller reveal how an understanding of adult attachment-the most advanced relationship science in existence today-can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways: Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.In this book Levine and Heller guide readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25540563M/Attached<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/attached-summary/<br><br>
Braving The Wilderness<br>True belonging doesn't require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who are.BrenÃ© Brown has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives â experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines our understanding of what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarisation shaped by fear and divisive ideological and political rhetoric.With her trademark mix of research, storytelling and honesty, Brown sets out a clear roadmap based on the four practices of true belonging that challenge how we think about ourselves, show up with one another, and find our way back to courage and connection.A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organisations and culture.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Braving-Wilderness-quest-belonging-courage/dp/1785041754?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/braving-the-wilderness-summary/<br><br>

Labor Of Love<br>A brilliant and surprising investigation into why we date the way we doIt seems as though every week thereâs a new app available on your smartphone promising dates aplentyâjust swipe right. A mate, on the other hand, is becoming harder and harder to find. The age-old quest for true love requires more effort than ever before. Letâs face it: Dating is work.Which, as it happens, is exactly where it began, in the nineteenth centuryâas prostitution. In Labor of Love, Moira Weigel dives into the secret history of dating while holding up a mirror to the contemporary dating landscape, revealing why we date the way we do and explaining why it feels so much like work. This isnât a guide to âgetting the guyâ; there are no ridiculous ârulesâ to follow in Labor of Love. This is a brilliant, fresh, and utterly original approach to help us understand how dating was invented and, hopefully, to lead us closer to the happy ending that it promises.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Labor-Love-Invention-Moira-Weigel/dp/0374182531?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/labor-of-love-summary/<br><br>

Social Intelligence<br>Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are âwired to connectâ and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodiesâdown to the level of our genesâfor good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a âneural balletâ that connects us brain to brain with those around us.Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitaminsâand bad relationships like poisons. We can âcatchâ other peopleâs emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the âdark sideâ of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for âmindsight,â as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.Is there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruismâprovided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26324.Social_Intelligence<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/social-intelligence-summary/<br><br>

During her multibook investigation into understanding human nature, Gretchen Rubin realized that by asking the seemingly dry question "How do I respond to expectations?" we gain explosive self-knowledge. She discovered that based on their answer, people fit into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behavior, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and engage more effectively. More than 600,000 people have taken her online quiz, and managers, doctors, teachers, spouses, and parents already use the framework to help people make significant, lasting change.

The Power Of The Other<br>An expert on the psychology of leadership and bestselling author of Integrity, Necessary Endings, and Boundaries For Leaders identifies the critical ingredient for personal and professional wellbeing.Most leadership coaching focuses on helping leaders build their skills and knowledge and close performance gaps. These are necessary, but not sufficient. Using evidence from from neuroscience and his work with leaders, Dr. Cloud shows that the best performers draw on another vital resource: personal and professional relationships that fuel growth and help them surpass current limits. Popular wisdom suggests that we should not allow others to have power over us, but the reality is that they do, for better or for worse. Consider the boss who diminishes you through cutting remarks versus one who challenges you to get better. Or the colleague who always seeks the limelight versus the one who gives you the confidence to finish a difficult project. Or the spouse who is honest and supportive versus the one who resents your success. No matter how talented, intelligent, or experienced, the greatest leaders share one commonality: the power of the others in their lives. Combining engaging case studies, persuasive findings from cutting-edge brain research, and examples from his consulting practice, Cloud argues that whether youâre a Navy SEAL or a corporate executive, outstanding performance depends on having the right kind of connections to fuel personal growth and minimize toxic associations and their effects. Presenting a dynamic model of the impact these different kinds of connections produce, Cloud shows readers how to get more from themselves by drawing on the strength and expertise of others. You donât have a choice whether or not others have power in your life, but you can choose what kinds of relationships you want.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27218559M/The_power_of_the_other<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-power-of-the-other-summary/<br><br>

The Speed Of Trust<br>Over two million copies sold.Stephen M. R. Covey shows how trustâand the speed at which it is established with clients, employees, and all stakeholdersâis the single most critical component of a successful leader and organization.Stephen M. R. Covey, widely known as one of the worldâs leading authorities on trust, asserts that it is âthe most overlooked, misunderstood, underutilized asset to enable performance. Its impact, for good or bad, is dramatic and pervasive. Itâs something you canât escape.â Thankfully, itâs is also the thing that can dramatically improve your personal and professional success.Why trust? The simple, often overlooked fact is this: work gets done with and through people. The Speed of Trust offers an unprecedented and eminently practical look at exactly how trust functions in every transaction and every relationshipâfrom the most personal to the broadest, most indirect interaction. It specifically demonstrates how to establish trust intentionally so that you and your organization can forego the time-killing, bureaucratic check-and-balance processes that is so often deployed in lieu of actual trust.This 2018 updated edition includes an insightful afterword by the author which explores ten key reasons why trust is more relevant now than ever beforeâincluding how trust is the new currency of our world today.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076.The_Speed_of_Trust<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-speed-of-trust-summary/<br><br>

Why We Love<br>A groundbreaking exploration of our most complex and mysterious emotionElation, mood swings, sleeplessness, and obsessionÃ¢â¬âthese are the tell-tale signs of someone in the throes of romantic passion. In this revealing new book, renowned anthropologist Helen Fisher explains why this experienceÃ¢â¬âwhich cuts across time, geography, and genderÃ¢â¬âis a force as powerful as the need for food or sleep.Why We Love begins by presenting the results of a scientific study in which Fisher scanned the brains of people who had just fallen madly in love. She proves, at last, what researchers had only suspected: when you fall in love, primordial areas of the brain Ã¢â¬Ålight upÃ¢â¬ with increased blood flow, creating romantic passion. Fisher uses this new research to show exactly what you experience when you fall in love, why you choose one person rather than another, and how romantic love affects your sex drive and your feelings of attachment to a partner. She argues that all animals feel romantic attraction, that love at first sight comes out of nature, and that human romance evolved for crucial reasons of survival. Lastly, she offers concrete suggestions on how to control this ancient passion, and she optimistically explores the future of romantic love in our chaotic modern world.Provocative, enlightening, and persuasive, Why We Love offers radical new answers to the age-old question of what love is and thus provides invaluable new insights into keeping love alive.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Love-Chemistry-Romantic/dp/0805069135?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-love-summary/<br><br>
