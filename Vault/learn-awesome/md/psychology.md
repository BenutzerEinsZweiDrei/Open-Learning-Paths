Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011) - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>Major New York Times bestsellerWinner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award in 2012Selected by the New York Times Book Review as one of the best books of 2011A Globe and Mail Best Books of the Year 2011 TitleOne of The Economist's 2011 Books of the Year One of The Wall Street Journal's Best Nonfiction Books of the Year 20112013 Presidential Medal of Freedom RecipientIn the international bestseller, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacationâeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal livesâand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/thinking-fast-and-slow-summary/<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26208390M/Thinking_fast_and_slow<br><br>

The Willpower Instinct<br> One of the world's most esteemed and influential psychologists, Roy F. Baumeister, teams with New York Times science writer John Tierney to reveal the secrets of self-control and how to master it. In Willpower, the pioneering researcher Roy F. Baumeister collaborates with renowned New York Times science writer John Tierney to revolutionize our understanding of the most coveted human virtue: self-control.In what became one of the most cited papers in social science literature, Baumeister discovered that willpower actually operates like a muscle: it can be strengthened with practice and fatigued by overuse. Willpower is fueled by glucose, and it can be bolstered simply by replenishing the brain's store of fuel. That's why eating and sleeping- and especially failing to do either of those-have such dramatic effects on self-control (and why dieters have such a hard time resisting temptation).Baumeister's latest research shows that we typically spend four hours every day resisting temptation. No wonder people around the world rank a lack of self-control as their biggest weakness. Willpower looks to the lives of entrepreneurs, parents, entertainers, and artists-including David Blaine, Eric Clapton, and others-who have flourished by improving their self-control.The lessons from their stories and psychologists' experiments can help anyone. You learn not only how to build willpower but also how to conserve it for crucial moments by setting the right goals and using the best new techniques for monitoring your progress. Once you master these techniques and establish the right habits, willpower gets easier: you'll need less conscious mental energy to avoid temptation. That's neither magic nor empty self-help sloganeering, but rather a solid path to a better life.Combining the best of modern social science with practical wisdom, Baumeister and Tierney here share the definitive compendium of modern lessons in willpower. As our society has moved away from the virtues of thrift and self-denial, it often feels helpless because we face more temptations than ever. But we also have more knowledge and better tools for taking control of our lives. However we define happiness-a close- knit family, a satisfying career, financial security-we won't reach it without mastering self-control.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206-the-willpower-instinct<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-willpower-instinct-summary/<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/willpower-summary/<br>summary|https://www.amazon.in/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/0143122231?tag=learnawesome-21<br><br>

Pre-Suasion<br>The author of the legendary bestseller Influence, social psychologist Robert Cialdini shines a light on effective persuasion and reveals that the secret doesnât lie in the message itself, but in the key moment before that message is delivered.What separates effective communicators from truly successful persuaders? Using the same combination of rigorous scientific research and accessibility that made his Influence an iconic bestseller, Robert Cialdini explains how to capitalize on the essential window of time before you deliver an important message. This âprivileged moment for changeâ prepares people to be receptive to a message before they experience it. Optimal persuasion is achieved only through optimal pre-suasion. In other words, to change âmindsâ a pre-suader must also change âstates of mind.âHis first solo work in over thirty years, Cialdiniâs Pre-Suasion draws on his extensive experience as the most cited social psychologist of our time and explains the techniques a person should implement to become a master persuader. Altering a listenerâs attitudes, beliefs, or experiences isnât necessary, says Cialdiniâall thatâs required is for a communicator to redirect the audienceâs focus of attention before a relevant action.From studies on advertising imagery to treating opiate addiction, from the annual letters of Berkshire Hathaway to the annals of history, Cialdini draws on an array of studies and narratives to outline the specific techniques you can use on online marketing campaigns and even effective wartime propaganda. He illustrates how the artful diversion of attention leads to successful pre-suasion and gets your targeted audience primed and ready to say, âYes.â<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29238799-pre-suasion<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/pre-suasion-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/PreSuasion<br><br>

13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do<br>The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Mental StrengthEveryone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results holds us back. This list of things mentally strong people don't do resonated so much with readers that when it was picked up by Forbes.com it received ten million views.Now, for the first time, Morin expands upon the thirteen things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Morin writes with searing honesty, incorporating anecdotes from her work as a college psychology instructor and psychotherapist as well as personal stories about how she bolstered her own mental strength when tragedy threatened to consume her.Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Things-Mentally-Strong-People-Dont/dp/0062358308?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/13-things-mentally-strong-people-dont-do-summary/<br><br>

A First-Rate Madness<br>This New York Times bestseller is a myth-shattering exploration of the powerful connections between mental illness and leadership.Historians have long puzzled over the apparent mental instability of great and terrible leaders alike: Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, Hitler, and others. In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Programme at Tufts Medical Center, offers and sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disorders also make for the best leaders in times of crisis.From the importance of Lincoln's "depressive realism" to the lacklustre leadership of exceedingly sane men as Neville Chamberlain, A First-Rate Madness overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357675-a-first-rate-madness<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-first-rate-madness-summary/<br><br>
A Force For Good<br>For more than half a century, in such books as The Art of Happiness and The Dalai Lamaâs Little Book of Inner Peace, the Dalai Lama has guided us along the path to compassion and taught us how to improve our inner lives. In A Force for Good, with the help of his longtime friend Daniel Goleman, the New York Times bestselling author of Emotional Intelligence, the Dalai Lama explains how to turn our compassionate energy outward. This revelatory and inspiring work provides a singular vision for transforming the world in practical and positive ways. Â  Much more than just the most prominent exponent of Tibetan Buddhism, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is also a futurist who possesses a profound understanding of current events and a remarkable canniness for modern social issues. When he takes the stage worldwide, people listen. A Force for Good combines the central concepts of the Dalai Lama, empirical evidence that supports them, and true stories of people who are putting his ideas into actionâshowing how harnessing positive energies and directing them outward has lasting and meaningful effects. Goleman details the science of compassion and how this singular guiding motivation has the power to Â  â¢ break such destructive social forces as corruption, collusion, and bias â¢ heal the planet by refocusing our concerns toward our impact on the systems that support all life â¢ reverse the tendency toward systemic inequity through transparency and accountability â¢ replace violence with dialogue â¢ counter us-and-them thinking by recognizing human oneness â¢ create new economic systems that work for everyone, not just the powerful and rich â¢ design schooling that teaches empathy, self-mastery, and ethics Â  Millions of people have turned to the Dalai Lama for his unparalleled insight into living happier, more purposeful lives. Now, when the world needs his guidance more than ever, he shows how every compassion-driven human actâno matter how smallâis integral for a more peaceful, harmonious world, building a force for a better future. Â  Revelatory, motivating, and highly persuasive, A Force for Good is arguably the most important work from one of the worldâs most influential spiritual and political figures.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Force-Good-Dalai-Lamas-Vision/dp/0553394894?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/a-force-for-good-summary/<br><br>

Against Empathy<br>New York Post Best Book of 2016We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we donât have enough of it.Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In AGAINST EMPATHY, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion.Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nationsâwho to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and who to imprisonâare too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system; from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, andâyesâultimately more moral.Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, AGAINST EMPATHY shows us that, when it comes to both major policy decisions and the choices we make in our everyday lives, limiting our impulse toward empathy is often the most compassionate choice we can make.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100194-against-empathy<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/against-empathy-summary/<br><br>
Inner Engineering<br>New York Times Bestseller: Thought leader, visionary, philanthropist, mystic, and yogi Sadhguru presents Western readers with a time-tested path to achieving absolute well-being: the classical science of yoga.The practice of hatha yoga, as we commonly know it, is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy.A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means âdispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life.â The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27220077M/Inner_engineering<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/inner-engineering-summary/<br><br>

Attached<br>We rely on science to tell us everything from what to eat to when and how long to exercise, but what about relationships? Is there a scientific explanation for why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle? According to psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, the answer is a resounding "yes."In Attached, Levine and Heller reveal how an understanding of adult attachment-the most advanced relationship science in existence today-can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways: Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness. Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.In this book Levine and Heller guide readers in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25540563M/Attached<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/attached-summary/<br><br>

Aware<br>
  This groundbreaking new book from New York Times bestselling author Daniel Siegel, M.D., introduces readers to his pioneering meditation practice that draws on cutting-edge brain science.
In Aware, New York Times bestselling author Daniel J. Siegel introduces readers to his life-changing meditation program, The Wheel of Awareness. Whether the reader has no experience with reflective practices or is an experienced practitioner, Aware provides practical instruction for mastering this brilliant tool for cultivating more focus, presence, and peace in one's day-to-day life.Dr. Siegel reveals in this fascinating book how mindfulness practices such as meditation have the capacity to, quite literally, re-wire our brains as "neurons that fire together wire together." According to Siegel, fear, anxiety, and stress in our lives can tend to send our thoughts traveling down the same neural pathways. Our thinking can become rigid or disjointed. Through developing a Wheel of Awareness practice, however, we strengthen our minds by expanding our awareness of how our mind is actually functioning and - in turn - we are able to gently coax our thoughts to travel in healthier, more productive directions.An in-depth look at the brain science that underlies meditation's effectiveness, Aware will guide you in developing a meditation practice that will inspire you to be more focused and present in your life as well as more emotionally resilient in the face of stress and the challenges life may throw your way.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26966421M/Aware<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/aware-summary/<br><br>
Blink - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/blink-summary/<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23273215M/Blink<br><br>

Brainstorm<br>A New York Times bestseller! Between the ages of twelve and twenty-four, the brain changes in important and, at times, challenging ways. In Brainstorm, Dr. Daniel Siegel busts a number of commonly held myths about adolescenceâfor example, that it is merely a stage of Âimmaturityâ filled with often Âcrazyâ behavior. According to Siegel, during adolescence we learn vital skills, such as how to leave home and enter the larger world, connect deeply with others, and safely experiment and take risks. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, Siegel explores exciting ways in which understanding how the brain functions can improve the lives of adolescents, making their relationships more fulfilling and less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707532-brainstorm<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/brainstorm-summary/<br><br>
Braving The Wilderness<br>True belonging doesn't require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who are.BrenÃ© Brown has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives â experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines our understanding of what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarisation shaped by fear and divisive ideological and political rhetoric.With her trademark mix of research, storytelling and honesty, Brown sets out a clear roadmap based on the four practices of true belonging that challenge how we think about ourselves, show up with one another, and find our way back to courage and connection.A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organisations and culture.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Braving-Wilderness-quest-belonging-courage/dp/1785041754?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/braving-the-wilderness-summary/<br><br>
Buddha’s Brain<br>Jesus, Moses, the Buddha, and other great teachers were born with brains built essentially like anyone else's. Then they used their minds to change their brains in ways that changed history.With the new breakthroughs in neuroscience, combined with the insights from thousands of years of contemplative practice, you, too, can shape your own brain for greater happiness, love, and wisdom.Buddha's Brain joins the forces of modern science with ancient teachings to show readers how to have greater emotional balance in turbulent times, as well as healthier relationships, more effective actions, and a deeper religious or spiritual practice.Well-referenced and grounded in science, the book is full of practical tools and skills readers can use in daily life to tap the unused potential of the brain-and rewire it over time for greater peace and well-being.If you can change your brain, you can change your life.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness/dp/1491518669?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/buddhas-brain-summary/<br><br>
Can’t Hurt Me<br>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare â poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him âThe Fittest (Real) Man in America.â  In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/cant-hurt-me-summary/<br><br>
Counterclockwise<br>If we could turn back the clock psychologically, could we also turn it back physically? For more than thirty years, award-winning social psychologist Ellen Langer has studied this provocative question, and now, in Counterclockwise, she presents the answer: Opening our minds to what's possible, instead of presuming impossibility, can lead to better health-at any age.Drawing on landmark work in the field and her own body of colorful and highly original experiments-including the first detailed discussion of her "counterclockwise" study, in which elderly men lived for a week as though it was 1959 and showed dramatic improvements in their hearing, memory, dexterity, appetite, and general well-being-Langer shows that the magic of rejuvenation and ongoing good health lies in being aware of the ways we mindlessly react to social and cultural cues. Examining the hidden decisions and vocabulary that shape the medical world ("chronic" versus "acute," "cure" versus "remission"), the powerful physical effects of placebos, and the intricate but often defeatist ways we define our physical health, Langer challenges the idea that the limits we assume and impose on ourselves are real.

Daring Greatly<br>The #1 New York Times bestseller, now in paperback. From thought leader Dr. BrenÃ© Brown, a transformative new vision for the way we lead, love, work, parent, and educate that teaches us the power of vulnerability.Â âIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.ââTheodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, Dr. BrenÃ© Brown dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, and the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: âWhen we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.âDaring Greatly is not about winning or losing. Itâs about courage. In a world where ânever enoughâ dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. Itâs even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means thereâs a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arenaâwhether itâs a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26630004M/Daring_Greatly_How_the_Courage_to_Be_Vulnerable_Transforms_the_Way_We_Live_Love_Parent_and_Lead<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/daring-greatly-summary/<br><br>

Decisive - Summary by Derek Sivers<br>The four principles that can help us to overcome our brains' natural biases to make better, more informed decisions -- in our lives, careers, families and organizations.In Decisive, Chip Heath and Dan Heath, the bestselling authors of Made to Stick and Switch, tackle the thorny problem of how to overcome our natural biases and irrational thinking to make better decisions, about our work, lives, companies and careers.Â Â Â Â When it comes to decision making, our brains are flawed instruments.Â  But given that we are biologically hard-wired to act foolishly and behave irrationally at times, how can we do better?Â  A number of recent bestsellers have identified how irrational our decision making can be.Â  But being aware of a bias doesn't correct it, just as knowing that you are nearsighted doesn't help you to see better.Â  In Decisive, the Heath brothers, drawing on extensive studies, stories and research, offer specific, practical tools that can help us to think more clearly about our options, and get out of our heads, to improve our decision making, at work and at home.<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Decisive<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798078-decisive<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/decisive-summary/<br><br>
Digital Minimalism<br>The key to living well in a high tech world is to spend much less time using technology.Georgetown computer scientist Cal Newport's Deep Work sparked a movement around the idea that unbroken concentration produces far more value than the electronic busyness that defines the modern work day. But his readers had an urgent follow-up question: What about technology in our personal lives?In recent years, our culture's relationship with personal technology has transformed from something exciting into something darker. Innovations like smartphones and social media are useful, but many of us are increasingly troubled by how much control these tools seem to exert over our daily experiences--including how we spend our free time and how we feel about ourselves.In Digital Minimalism, Newport proposes a bold solution: a minimalist approach to technology use in which you radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small set of carefully-selected activities while happily ignoring the rest.He mounts a vigorous defense for this less-is-more approach, combining historical examples with case studies of modern digital minimalists to argue that this philosophy isn't a rejection of technology, but instead a necessary realignment to ensure that these tools serve us, not the other way around.To make these principles practical, he takes us inside the growing subculture of digital minimalists who have built rich lives on a foundation of intentional technology use, and details a decluttering process that thousands have already used to simplify their online lives. He also stresses the importance of never clicking "like," explores the underappreciated value of analog hobbies, and draws lessons from the "attention underground"--a resistance movement fighting the tech companies' attempts to turn us into gadget addicts.Digital Minimalism is an indispensable guide for anyone looking to reclaim their life from the alluring diversions of the digital world.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26832542M/Digital_Minimalism<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/digital-minimalism-summary/<br><br>
Dollars and Sense<br>Why is paying for things painful?Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because weâve overpaid for it in the past?Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldnât spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal financeâs most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.Exploring a wide range of everyday topicsâfrom the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the Â pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday salesâAriely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether itâs the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34323010-dollars-and-sense<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/dollars-and-sense-summary/<br><br>

Drive<br>The New York Times bestseller that gives readers a paradigm-shattering new way to think about motivation Most people believe that the best way to motivate is with rewards like moneyâthe carrot-and-stick approach. That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at homeâis the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâand how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivationâautonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/drive-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Drive<br><br>
Ego Is The Enemy<br>âWhile the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, Iâve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.â â from the PrologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?Â  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, âyou will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work youâve set out to achieve.â<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ego-is-the-enemy-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/EgoEnemy<br><br>
Emotional Agility<br>The counterintuitive approach to achieving your true potential, heralded by the Harvard Business Review as a groundbreaking idea of the year. Â  The path to fulfillment, whether at work or at home, is almost never a straight line. Ask anyone who has achieved their biggest goals or who thrives in their relationships, and youâll hear stories of many unexpected detours along the way. What separates those who rise to these challenges and those who get derailed? The answer is agilityâemotional agility.Emotional agility is a four-step approach that allows us to navigate lifeâs twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind. In her more than twenty years of research, Susan David has found that no matter how intelligent, resilient, or creative people are, when they ignore how situations or interactions make them feel, they miss opportunities to gain insight, getting hooked by thoughts, emotions, and habits that prevent them from reaching their full potential. Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.Drawing on her extensive professional research, her international consulting work, and her own experiences growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa and losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can become more emotionally agile and thrive in an uncertain world. Written with authority, wit, and empathy, Emotional Agility will help you live your most successful life, whoever you are and whatever you face.

Emotional Intelligence<br>Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our "two minds"âthe rational and the emotionalâand how they together shape our destiny.Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. The best news is that "emotional literacy" is not fixed early in life. Every parent, every teacher, every business leader, and everyone interested in a more civil society, has a stake in this compelling vision of human possibility.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26329.Emotional_Intelligence<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/emotional-intelligence-summary/<br><br>

Everything Is F*cked<br>From the author of the international mega-bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck comes a counterintuitive guide to the problems of hope. We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best itâs ever beenâwe are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*ckedâthe planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldnât even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.Whatâs going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, itâs Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didnâtâand worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the âsubtle artâ of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.Now, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedomâand even of hope itself.With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably havenât considered before. Itâs another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43808723-everything-is-f-cked<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/everything-is-fcked-summary/<br><br>

Grit<br>In this instant New York Times bestseller, Angela Duckworth shows anyone striving to succeed that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls âgrit.â âInspiration for non-geniuses everywhereâ (People).The daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of âgenius,â Angela Duckworth is now a celebrated researcher and professor. It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance.  In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what sheâs learned from interviewing dozens of high achieversâfrom JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.  âDuckworthâs ideas about the cultivation of tenacity have clearly changed some lives for the betterâ (The New York Times Book Review). Among Gritâs most valuable insights: any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; when it comes to child-rearing, neither a warm embrace nor high standards will work by themselves; how to trigger lifelong interest; the magic of the Hard Thing Rule; and so much more. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how thatânot talent or luckâmakes all the difference. This is âa fascinating tour of the psychological research on successâ (The Wall Street Journal).<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/grit-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Grit<br><br>

Happiness<br>There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.  The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in Happiness is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.  Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. Happiness is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.  From one of the leading voices in the new field of happiness studies comes a groundbreaking statement of the case: what happiness is, exactly, and how to get more of it, as individuals and as a society<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100120.Happiness<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/happiness-summary/<br><br>

How To Be A Stoic<br>In the tradition of How to Live and How Proust Can Change Your Life, a philosopher asks how ancient Stoicism can help us flourish todayWhenever we worry about what to eat, how to love, or simply how to be happy, we are worrying about how to lead a good life. No goal is more elusive. In How to Be a Stoic, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us--and How to Be a Stoic is the essential guide.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Stoic-Ancient-Philosophy/dp/1541644530?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-to-be-a-stoic-summary/<br><br>

How We Learn<br>In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know about learning and memory todayâand how we can apply it to our own lives.Â  From an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and ignorance are the enemies of success. Weâre told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital. Â  But what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong?Â And what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort? Â  In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? Careyâs search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday livesâand less of a chore. Â  By road testing many of the counterintuitive techniques described in this book, Carey shows how we can flex the neural muscles that make deep learning possible. Along the way he reveals why teachers should give final exams on the first day of class, why itâs wise to interleave subjects and concepts when learning any new skill, and when itâs smarter to stay up late prepping for that presentation than to rise early for one last cram session. And if this requires some suspension of disbelief, thatâs because the research defies what weâve been told, throughout our lives, about how best to learn. Â  The brain is not like a muscle, at least not in any straightforward sense. It is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian rhythms, as well as to location and environment. It doesnât take orders well, to put it mildly. If the brain is a learning machine, then it is an eccentric one. In How We Learn, Benedict CareyÂ shows us how to exploit its quirks to our advantage. Â Praise for How We LearnâThis book is a revelation. I feel as if Iâve owned a brain for fifty-four years and only now discovered the operating manual.ââMary Roach, bestselling author of Stiff and GulpâA welcome rejoinder to the faddish notion that learning is all about the hours put in.â

If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy<br>Could the same traits that drive your career success also be keeping you from being happier?Fifteen years after getting his MBA, Raj Raghunathan spent some time with his old classmates. He noticed that though theyâd all done well, there didnât appear to be much correlation between their academic success and career success. What Raj found even more curious was the even smaller correlation between career success and what he calls life success. The greater the career success, the more unhappy, out of shape, harried and distracted his friends were. Â If intelligence helps with decision-making, smart people should naturally make better life choices. So why are so many of the smartest, brightest, most successful people profoundly unhappy?Â  Raj set out to find an answer to this problem, and extensively researched happiness not just of students and business people, but also stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others. Â If Youâre So Smart, Why Arenât You Happy? takes readers on a fun and meaningful tour of the best research available on how some of the very determinants of success may also come to deflate happiness. Raghunathan explores the seven most common inclinations that successful people need to overcome, and the seven habits they should adopt instead. Among his surprising findings...Â Â·The correlation between wealth and happiness is much smaller than you'd expect it to beÂ·Generosity is not only a key to happiness, but a determining factor of long term successÂ·Appreciating uncertainty, rather than seekingÂ  full control of outcomes, is necessary for happinessÂ If Youâre So Smart, Why Arenât You Happy? will give you a powerful new perspective on your work, personal goals and relationships, whether youâre already successful or just starting out.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27205509M/If_you're_so_smart_why_aren't_you_happy<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-happy-summary/<br><br>
Ikigai - Summary by Derek Sivers<br>Bring meaning and joy to all your days with this internationally bestselling guide to the Japanese concept of ikigai (pronounced ee-key-guy)âthe happiness of always being busyâas revealed by the daily habits of the worldâs longest-living people.Whatâs your ikigai?âOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.â âJapanese proverb According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigaiâa reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the worldâs longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigaiâthe place where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersectâmeans that each day is infused with meaning. Itâs the reason we get up in the morning. Itâs also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact thereâs no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because theyâve found a real purpose in lifeâthe happiness of always being busy. In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-oldsâone of the worldâs Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, andâtheir best-kept secretâhow they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesnât want to find happiness in every day?<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Ikigai<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Ikigai-Japanese-Secret-Long-Happy/dp/0143130722?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ikigai-summary/<br><br>
Invisible Influence<br>Jonah Berger, the bestselling author of Contagious, explores the subtle, secret influences that affect the decisions we make from what we buy, to the careers we choose, to what we eat in his latest New York Times bestseller that is a rare business book that s both informative and enough fun to take to the beach (Fortune.com). If you re like most people, you think your individual tastes and opinions drive your choices and behaviors. You wear a certain jacket because you liked how it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong. Without our realizing it, other people s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous. Even strangers have an impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same). But social influence doesn t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we imitate others around us. But in other cases we avoid particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don t want to look like a soccer mom. By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it and learn how we can use this knowledge to exercise more control over our own behavior. In Invisible Influence, Jonah Berger is consistently entertaining, applying science to real life in surprising ways and explaining research through narrative. His book fascinates because it opens up the moving parts of a mysterious machine, allowing readers to watch them in action (Publishers Weekly)."<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27407178M/Invisible_Influence<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/invisible-influence-summary/<br><br>

Lost Connections<br>From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was toldâlike his entire generationâthat his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this questionâand he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causesâand they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hariâs journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlinâall showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.Just as Chasing the Scream transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, Lost Connections will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxietyâone that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/lost-connections-summary/<br><br>
Loving What Is<br>Out of nowhere, like a breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and âThe Work.â In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, âItâs not the problem that causes our suffering; itâs our thinking about the problem.â Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. Youâll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Workâs power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls âa lover of reality.â<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22990522M/Loving_what_is<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/loving-what-is-summary/<br><br>

Mindsight - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>From a pioneer in the field of mental health comes a groundbreaking book on the healing power of "mindsight," the potent skill that is the basis for both emotional and social intelligence. Mindsight allows you to make positive changes in your brain-and in your life.- Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can' t shake?- Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?- Do you ever wonder why you can't stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?- Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn't mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients heal themselves from painful events in the past and liberate themselves from obstacles blocking their happiness in the present. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes- a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal- a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread- a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a "vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut," and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection- a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is "like watching myself from outside myself" and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting herThese and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.A book as inspiring as it is informative, as practical as it is profound, Mindsight offers exciting new proof that we aren't hardwired to behave in certain ways, but instead have the ability to harness the power of our minds to resculpt the neural pathways of our brains in ways that will be life-transforming.<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/mindsight-summary/<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6315775-mindsight<br><br>

Fascinating, provocative, and empowering, Outwitting the Devil shows how to create your own path to success, harmony, and fulfillment in an age of uncertainty and fear.

Payoff<br>Bestselling author Dan Ariely reveals fascinating new insights into motivation--showing that the subject is far more complex than we ever imagined. Every day we work hard to motivate ourselves, the people we live with, the people who work for and do business with us. In this way, much of what we do can be defined as being "motivators." From the boardroom to the living room, our role as motivators is complex, and the more we try to motivate partners and children, friends and coworkers, the clearer it becomes that the story of motivation is far more intricate and fascinating than we've assumed. Payoff investigates the true nature of motivation, our partial blindness to the way it works, and how we can bridge this gap. With studies that range from Intel to a kindergarten classroom, Ariely digs deep to find the root of motivation--how it works and how we can use this knowledge to approach important choices in our own lives. Along the way, he explores intriguing questions such as: Can giving employees bonuses harm productivity? Why is trust so crucial for successful motivation? What are our misconceptions about how to value our work?

Whether someone is trying to qualify for the Olympics, break ground in mathematical theory or craft an artistic masterpiece, many of the practices that lead to great success are the same. In Peak Performance, Brad Stulberg, a former McKinsey and Company consultant and journalist who covers health and the science of human performance, and Steve Magness, a performance scientist and coach of Olympic athletes, team up to demystify these practices and demonstrate how everyone can achieve their best.The first book of its kind, Peak Performance combines the inspiring stories of top performers across a range of capabilities - from athletic, to intellectual, to artistic - with the latest scientific insights into the cognitive and neurochemical factors that drive performance in all domains. In doing so, Peak Performance uncovers new linkages that hold promise as performance enhancers but have been overlooked in our traditionally-siloed ways of thinking. The result is a life-changing book in which readers will learn how to enhance their performance by a myriad of ways including: optimally alternating between periods of intense work and rest; developing and harnessing the power of a self-transcending purpose; and priming the body and mind for enhanced productivity.In revealing the science of great performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success, and coaches readers on how to use them. If you want to take your game to the next level, whatever "your game" may be, Peak Performance will teach you how.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Performance-Elevate-Burnout-Science/dp/162336793X?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/peak-performance-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/PeakPerformance<br><br>
Psyched Up<br>Harvard Business Review editor Daniel McGinn explains science of how the difference between success and failure at life's big moments can come down to what you do in the last few minutes before you start. The science of effective practice and how to perform at peak levels has long been a popular subject of research. But more recently, scientists have uncovered the underappreciated but important bridge between the two--mental preparation. Chances are, you aren't mentally preparing effectively, even though you can truly get better results at life's high-pressure moments with science-backed practices. Psyched is a book about what we can do before you have to perform. It examines new ways to deal with the flood of adrenaline, increase focus, and otherwise optimize our emotions before we take the stage. McGinn investigates: .how trying to calm down backfires.what to put into your pre-performance music mix.what kinds of pep talks work best..And why he wrote it on Malcolm Gladwell's old keyboard He also introduces readers to high-performing professionals who are putting these techniques to work--superstars like General Stanley McChrystal, Nascar champion driver Jimmie Johnson, Boston College football coach Steve Addazio, legendary tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, and others who, despite years of practice and enviable track records, will ultimately be judged on their ability to deliver a single solid performance when it counts. As the nature of work has changed, many professionals now succeed or fail based less on repetitive daily tasks, and more on a thin slice of evaluative moments. If you work 2,000 hours a year but your overall success rests mostly on your performance during a few dozen crucial hours, the tools in this book should help you pull off your best performances when it counts the most."<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Psyched-Up-Science-Preparation-Succeed/dp/159184830X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/psyched-up-summary/<br><br>

QBQ!<br>The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, victim thinking, complaining, and procrastination. No organizationâor individualâcan successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability.Â Â  John G. Miller believes that the troubles that plague organizations cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In QBQ! The Question Behind the QuestionÂ®, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like âWhy do we have to go through all this change?â and âWho dropped the ball?â represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questionsâQBQsâsuch as âWhat can I do to contribute?â or âHow can I help solve the problem?â our lives and our organizations are transformed.THE QBQ! PROMISEThis remarkable and timely book provides a practical method for putting personal accountability into daily actions, with astonishing results: problems are solved, internal barriers come down, service improves, teams thrive, and people adapt to change more quickly. QBQ! is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to learn, grow, and change. Using this tool, each of us can add tremendous worth to our organizations and to our lives by eliminating blame, victim-thinking, and procrastination.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â QBQ! was written more than a decade ago and has helped countless readers practice personal accountability at work and at home.

Quiet<br>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introvertsâRosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniakâthat we owe many of the great contributions to society.In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25184609M/Quiet<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/quiet-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Quiet<br><br>
Reality Is Broken<br>Visionary game designer Jane McGonigal reveals how we can harness the power of games to solve real-world problems and boost global happiness.   More than 174 million Americans are gamers, and the average young person in the United States will spend ten thousand hours gaming by the age of twenty-one. According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that videogames are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world.Drawing on positive psychology, cognitive science, and sociology, Reality Is Broken uncovers how game designers have hit on core truths about what makes us happy and utilized these discoveriesto astonishing effect in virtual environments. Videogames consistently provide the exhilarating rewards, stimulating challenges, and epic victories that are so often lacking in the real world. But why, McGonigal asks, should we use the power of games for escapist entertainment alone? Her research suggests that gamers are expert problem solvers and collaborators because they regularly cooperate with other players to overcome daunting virtual challenges, and she helped pioneer a fast-growing genre of games that aims to turn gameplay to socially positive ends.In Reality Is Broken, she reveals how these new alternate reality games are already improving the quality of our daily lives, fighting social problems such as depression and obesity, and addressing vital twenty-first-century challenges-and she forecasts the thrilling possibilities that lie ahead. She introduces us to games like World Without Oil, a simulation designed to brainstorm-and therefore avert- the challenges of a worldwide oil shortage, and Evoke, a game commissioned by the World Bank Institute that sends players on missions to address issues from poverty to climate change.McGonigal persuasively argues that those who continue to dismiss games will be at a major disadvantage in the coming years. Gamers, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the collaborative and motivational power of games in their own lives, communities, and businesses. Written for gamers and nongamers alike, Reality Is Broken shows us that the future will belong to those who can understand, , and play games.Watch a Video<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24595354M/Reality_Is_Broken<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/reality-is-broken-summary/<br><br>
Rejection Proof<br>Rejection Proof is Jia Jiang's entertaining and inspiring account of conquering his fear of rejection, offering a completely new perspective on how to turn a no into a yes.Jia Jiang came to the United States with the dream of being the next Bill Gates. Despite early success in the corporate world, his first attempt to pursue his entrepreneurial dream ended in rejection. Jia was crushed and spiraled into a period of deep self-doubt. But he realized that his fear of rejection was a bigger obstacle than any single rejection would ever be, and he needed to find a way to cope with being told no without letting it destroy him. Thus was born his "100 days of rejection" experiment, during which he willfully sought rejection on a daily basis - from requesting a lesson in sales from a car salesman (no) to asking a flight attendant if he could make an announcement on the loudspeaker (yes) to his famous request to get Krispy Kreme doughnuts in the shape of Olympic rings (yes, with a viral video to prove it).Jia learned that even the most preposterous wish may be granted if you ask in the right way, and here he shares the secret of successful asking, how to pick targets, and how to tell when an initial no can be converted into something positive. But more important, he learned techniques for steeling himself against rejection and ways to develop his own confidence - a plan that can't be derailed by a single setback.Filled with great stories and valuable insight, Rejection Proof is a fun and thoughtful examination of how to overcome fear and dare to live more boldly.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Rejection-Proof-Became-Invincible-Through/dp/080414138X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rejection-proof-summary/<br><br>
Rewire<br>We humans tend to get in our own way time and time againâwhether it comes to not speaking up for ourselves, going back to bad romantic partners, dieting for the umpteenth try, or acting on any of a range of bad habits we just canât seem to shake. In Rewire, renowned psychotherapist Richard OâConnor, PhD, reveals exactly why our bad habits die so hard. We have two brainsâone a thoughtful, conscious, deliberative self, and the other an automatic self that makes most of our decisions without our attention. Using new research and knowledge about how the brain works, the book clears a path to lasting, effective change for behaviors that include:ProcrastinationOvereatingChronic disorganizationStaying in bad situationsExcessive worryingRisk takingPassive aggressionSelf-medicationBringing together many different fields in psychology and brain science, Dr. OâConnor gives you a road map to overcoming whatever self-destructive habits are plaguing you, with exercises throughout the book. We can rewire our brains to develop healthier circuitry, training the automatic self to make wiser decisions without having to think about it; ignore distractions; withstand temptations; see ourselves and the world more clearly; and interrupt our reflexive responses before they get us in trouble. Meanwhile, our conscious minds will be freed to view ourselves with compassion at the same time as we practice self-discipline. By learning valuable skills and habitsâincluding mindfulness, self-control, confronting fear, and freeing yourself from mindless guiltâwe can open ourselves to vastly more successful, productive, and happy lives. The book even demystifies how to overcome what Dr. OâConnor calls the âundertowâ (the mysterious force that sabotages our best efforts when weâre just on the edge of victory) for long-lasting change. Offering a valuable science-based new paradigm for rewiring our brains, Rewire is a refreshing guide to becoming a healthier, happier self.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Rewire-Overcome-Addictions-Self-Destruc-Behavior/dp/1594632561?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rewire-summary/<br><br>

So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed<br>Now aÂ  New York Times Â bestseller and from the author of The Psychopath Test, a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world's most underappreciated forces: shame.Â 'It's about the terror, isn't it?'Â 'The terror of what?' I said.Â 'The terror of being found out.'Â For the past three years, Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us - people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they're being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.Â A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people's faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.Â Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be,Â So You've Been Publicly ShamedÂ is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws - and the very scary part we all play in it.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571552-so-you-ve-been-publicly-shamed<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed-summary/<br><br>

Superbetter<br>
  An innovative guide to living gamefully, based on the program that has already helped nearly half a million people achieve remarkable personal growth
  
In 2009, internationally renowned game designer Jane McGonigal suffered a severe concussion. Unable to think clearly or work or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidal. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a resilience-building game. What started as a simple motivational exercise quickly became a set of rules for âpost-traumatic growthâ that she shared on her blog. These rules led to a digital game and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today nearly half a million people have played SuperBetter to get stronger, happier, and healthier.But the life-changing ideas behind SuperBetter are much bigger than just one game. In this book, McGonigal reveals a decadeâs worth of scientific research into the ways all gamesâincluding videogames, sports, and puzzlesâchange how we respond to stress, challenge, and pain. She explains how we can cultivate new powers of recovery and resilience in everyday life simply by adopting a more âgamefulâ mind-set. Being gameful means bringing the same psychological strengths we naturally display when we play gamesâsuch as optimism, creativity, courage, and determinationâto real-world goals.Drawing on hundreds of studies, McGonigal shows that getting superbetter is as simple as tapping into the three core psychological strengths that games help you build:Â Â Â â¢Â Your ability to control your attention, and therefore your thoughts and feelingsÂ Â Â â¢Â Your power to turn anyone into a potential ally, and to strengthen your existing relationships Your natural capacity to motivate yourself and super-charge your heroic qualities, like willpower, compassion, and determinationSuperBetter contains nearly 100 playful challenges anyone can undertake in order to build these gameful strengths. It includes stories and data from people who have used the SuperBetter method to get stronger in the face of illness, injury, and other major setbacks, as well as to achieve goals like losing weight, running a marathon, and finding a new job.As inspiring as it is down to earth, and grounded in rigorous research, SuperBetter is a proven game plan for a better life. Youâll never say that something is âjust a gameâ again.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611964-superbetter<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/superbetter-summary/<br><br>

The ADHD Advantage<br>Why ADHD could be the key to your successFor decades physicians delivered the diagnosis of ADHD to patients as bad news and warned them about a lifelong struggle of managing symptoms. But The ADHD Advantage explodes this outlook, showing that some of the most highly successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and entertainers have reached the pinnacle of success not in spite of their ADHD but because of it.Although the ADHD stereotype is someone who canât sit still, in reality people with ADHD are endlessly curious, often adventurous, willing to take smart risks, and unusually resilient. They are creative, visionary, and entrepreneurial. Sharing the stories of highly successful people with ADHD, Dr. Archer offers a vitally important and inspiring new way to recognize ADHD traits in oneself or in oneâs loved ones, and then leverage them to great advantageâwithout drugs.As someone who not only has ADHD himself but also has never used medication to treat it, Dr. Archer understands the condition from a unique standpoint. Armed with new science and research, he hopes to generate public interest and even debate with his positive message as he guides the millions of people with ADHD worldwide toward a whole new appreciation of their many strengths and full innate potential.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-Advantage-Diagnosis-Greatest-Strength/dp/0399573453?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-adhd-advantage-summary/<br><br>
The Age of Empathy<br>In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. Are we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests?By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals-and humans-are "preprogrammed to reach out." He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer "reassuring rumbles" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective-one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what perhaps could become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times."An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness."--Desmond Morris, author of The Naked Ape<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6525532-the-age-of-empathy<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-age-of-empathy-summary/<br><br>
The Antidote<br>Self-help books don't seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealthâeven if you can get itâdoesn't necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can't even agree on what "happiness" means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way?Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it's our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertaintyâthe very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, The Antidote is the intelligent person's guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-antidote-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Antidote<br><br>

The Biology of Belief<br>This 10th-anniversary edition of Bruce Liptonâs best-selling book The Biology of Belief has been updated to bolster the bookâs central premise with the latest scientific discoveriesâand there have been a lot in the last decade.The Biology of Belief is a groundbreaking work in the field of new biology. Former medical school professor and research scientist Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D., presents his experiments, and those of other leading-edge scientists, which examine in great detail the mechanisms by which cells receive and process information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life, showing that genes and DNA do not control our biology; instead, DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. This profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics has been hailed as a major breakthrough, showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90556.The_Biology_of_Belief<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-biology-of-belief-summary/<br><br>

The Eureka Factor<br>In a book perfect for readers of Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit, David Eagleman's Incognito, and Leonard Mlodinow's Subliminal, the cognitive neuroscientists who discovered how the brain has aha momentsâsudden creative insightsâexplain how they happen, when we need them, and how we can have more of them to enrich our lives and empower personal and professional success.Eureka or aha moments are sudden realizations that expand our understanding of the world and ourselves, conferring both personal growth and practical advantage. Such creative insights, as psychological scientists call them, were what conveyed an important discovery in the science of genetics to Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock, the melody of a Beatles ballad to Paul McCartney, and an understanding of the cause of human suffering to the Buddha. But these moments of clarity are not given only to the famous. Anyone can have them.In The Eureka Factor, John Kounios and Mark Beeman explain how insights arise and what the scientific research says about stimulating more of them. They discuss how various conditions affect the likelihood of your having an insight, when insight is helpful and when deliberate methodical thought is better suited to a task, what the relationship is between insight and intuition, and how the brain's right hemisphere contributes to creative thought.Written in a lively, engaging style, this book goes beyond scientific principles to offer productive techniques for realizing your creative potentialâat home and at work. The authors provide compelling anecdotes to illustrate how eureka experiences can be a key factor in your life. Attend a dinner party with Christopher Columbus to learn why we need insights. Go to a baseball game with the director of a classic Disney Pixar movie to learn about one important type of aha moment. Observe the behind-the-scenes arrangements for an Elvis Presley concert to learn why the timing of insights makes them difficult to use but crucial to study.Accessible and compelling, The Eureka Factor is a fascinating look at the human brain and its seemingly infinite capacity to surprise us.Advance praise for The Eureka FactorâThe Eureka Factor is a highly engaging and informative look into the fascinating topic of sudden creative insights. John Kounios and Mark Beeman convincingly show that what once seemed to be a mysterious feature of the human mind is yielding to dramatic advances in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Combining state-of-the-art research with compelling everyday examples, this book is essential reading for anyone who has ever wondered what makes it possible to experience an âAha' moment.ââDaniel L.

The Four Tendencies<br>In this groundbreaking analysis of personality type, bestselling author of Better Than Before and The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin reveals the one simple question that will transform what you do at home, at work, and in life.  During her multibook investigation into understanding human nature, Gretchen Rubin realized that by asking the seemingly dry question "How do I respond to expectations?" we gain explosive self-knowledge. She discovered that based on their answer, people fit into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behavior, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and engage more effectively. More than 600,000 people have taken her online quiz, and managers, doctors, teachers, spouses, and parents already use the framework to help people make significant, lasting change. The Four Tendencies hold practical answers if you've ever thought...Â· People can rely on me, but I can't rely on myself.Â· How can I help someone to follow good advice?Â· People say I ask too many questions.Â· How do I work with someone who refuses to do what I ask or who keeps telling me what to do?With sharp insight, compelling research, and hilarious examples, The Four Tendencies will help you get happier, healthier, more productive, and more creative. It's far easier to succeed when you know what works for you.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Four-Tendencies-Indispensable-Personality-Profiles/dp/1524760919?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-four-tendencies-summary/<br><br>
The Gifts Of Imperfection<br>New York Times best-selling author and professor BrenÃ© Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Brené rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24913849M/The_gifts_of_imperfection<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-gifts-of-imperfection-summary/<br><br>

The Interpretation Of Dreams<br>What are the most common dreams and why do we have them? What does a dream about death mean? What do dreams of swimming, failing, or flying symbolize?First published by Sigmund Freud in 1899, The Interpretation of Dreams considers why we dream and what it means in the larger picture of our psychological lives.

It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day.The Little Book of Hygge introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life, and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as:Get comfy. Take a break.Be here now. Turn off the phones.Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles.Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe.Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living.

The Presence Process<br>Why is it so difficult to simply be present? The reason is that our deeply suppressed emotional imprints from childhood â which Eckhart Tolle calls âthe pain-bodyâ â distract from an awareness of the present moment. Weâre not broken and donât need to be healed but rather, our discomfort needs to be integrated. The Presence Process is a journey that guides readers into taking responsibility for our emotional integration. It is a way to consciously grow up and become responsible for determining the quality of our personal experience. The book teaches readers how to exercise authentic personal responsibility in a practical manner and reveals the mechanics that shape the way they feel about their lives. It offers a simple, practical approach to accomplishing and maintaining personal peace in the midst of globally accelerating change, discomfort, conflict, and chaos.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Presence-Process-Journey-Present-Awareness/dp/1897238460?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-presence-process-summary/<br><br>

The Yes Brain<br>From the authors of The Whole-Brain Child and No-Drama Discipline,  an indispensable guide to unlocking your child's innate capacity for resilience, compassion, and creativity.When facing contentious issues such as screen time, food choices, and bedtime, children often act out or shut down, responding with reactivity instead of receptivity. This is what New York Times bestselling authors Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson call a No Brain response. But our kids can be taught to approach life with openness and curiosity. When kids work from a Yes Brain, they're more willing to take chances and explore. They're more curious and imaginative. They're better at relationships and handling adversity. In The Yes Brain, the authors give parents skills, scripts, and activities to bring kids of all ages into the beneficial "yes" state. You'll learn- the four fundamentals of the Yes Brain--balance, resilience, insight, and empathy--and how to strengthen them - the key to knowing when kids need a gentle push out of a comfort zone vs. needing the "cushion" of safety and familiarity - strategies for navigating away from negative behavioral and emotional states (aggression and withdrawal) and expanding your child's capacity for positivityThe Yes Brain is an essential tool for nurturing positive potential and keeping your child's inner spark glowing and growing strong.Praise for The Yes Brain"This unique and exciting book shows us how to help children embrace life with all of its challenges and thrive in the modern world. Integrating research from social development, clinical psychology, and neuroscience, it's a veritable treasure chest of parenting insights and techniques."--Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., author of

Why We Love<br>A groundbreaking exploration of our most complex and mysterious emotionElation, mood swings, sleeplessness, and obsessionÃ¢â¬âthese are the tell-tale signs of someone in the throes of romantic passion. In this revealing new book, renowned anthropologist Helen Fisher explains why this experienceÃ¢â¬âwhich cuts across time, geography, and genderÃ¢â¬âis a force as powerful as the need for food or sleep.Why We Love begins by presenting the results of a scientific study in which Fisher scanned the brains of people who had just fallen madly in love. She proves, at last, what researchers had only suspected: when you fall in love, primordial areas of the brain Ã¢â¬Ålight upÃ¢â¬ with increased blood flow, creating romantic passion. Fisher uses this new research to show exactly what you experience when you fall in love, why you choose one person rather than another, and how romantic love affects your sex drive and your feelings of attachment to a partner. She argues that all animals feel romantic attraction, that love at first sight comes out of nature, and that human romance evolved for crucial reasons of survival. Lastly, she offers concrete suggestions on how to control this ancient passion, and she optimistically explores the future of romantic love in our chaotic modern world.Provocative, enlightening, and persuasive, Why We Love offers radical new answers to the age-old question of what love is and thus provides invaluable new insights into keeping love alive.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Love-Chemistry-Romantic/dp/0805069135?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-love-summary/<br><br>
Why We Work<br>An eye-opening, groundbreaking tour of the purpose of work in our lives, showing how work operates in our culture and how you can find your own path to happiness in the workplace.Why do we work? The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.Weâve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, weâve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through âmenialâ jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.How did we get to this tangled place?
