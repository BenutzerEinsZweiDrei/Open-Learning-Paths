Gist.io<br>Sometimes, we want to share a bit of writing that is neither. Maybe we want to write for a specific audience, but don’t want to address the people who usually read our blogs. Maybe it’s just something that doesn’t fit into 140 characters.

Gist.io is a solution for that, inspired by Mike Bostock’s delightful bl.ocks.org

Accidental Genius<br>When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. Thatâs because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts, so we sound smart and in control, and so that we fit into society. But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How to get unstuck?Â For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique heâs used for years to solve all types of business problems, and generate ideas for books, articles and blog posts.Â Freewriting is deceptively simple: Start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor wonât be able to keep up with your output, and will be temporarily shunted into the background. Youâll now be able to think more honestly and resourcefully than before, and will generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldnât have created any other way.Â Levy shares six freewriting secrets designed to knock out your editor and let your genius run free. He also includes fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepowerâseven of which are new to this editionâand stories of problems he and others have solved through freewriting.Â Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your freewriting into something you can share with the world. Although Levy originally taught freewriting as a private brainstorming technique, over the years he and his clients have found that, with some tweaking, itâs a great way to generate content for books, articles, and other thought leadership pieces.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Accidental-Genius-Revolutionize-Thinking-Through/dp/1605095257?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/accidental-genius-summary/<br><br>
An Audience Of One<br>The creator of the Unmistakable Creative podcast makes a counterintuitive argument: By focusing your creative work on pleasing yourself, you can increase your productivity, happiness, and (eventually, paradoxically) the size of your audience.Creating for your own pleasure--whether you're writing a novel, composing songs, or painting a landscape--can seem pointless. It's tempting to focus on pursuing money and fame, rather than the process itself. But as Srini Rao warns, creating then turns into a chore that can harm your self-esteem and suck the pleasure out of life, rather than being a source of joy.Rao, host of the podcast The Unmistakable Creative, argues that we should counter this thinking by intentionally creating art for ourselves alone--an audience of one. In this book he shares the fascinating true stories of creatives who took this path, along with actionable tips and the research of creativity experts. You'll learn, for example:* How Oprah's intentional focus on her own work rather than the opinions of everyone else catapulted her into one of the most popular talk shows of all time.* How being process-driven can not only help you produce more work, but can make you happier outside of your creative time.* How to put together a creative "team of rivals" whose feedback can help you hone your craft and filter out useless feedback.By playing to an audience of one, we can find more happiness, increased productivity, and a greater sense of community.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26974345M/An_audience_of_one<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/an-audience-of-one-summary/<br><br>

Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t<br>There's a mantra that real writers know but wannabe writers donât. And the secret phrase is this:NOBODY WANTS TO READ YOUR SH*T. Recognizing this painful truth is the first step in the writer's transformation from amateur to professional. From Chapter Four: âWhen you understand that nobody wants to read your shit, you develop empathy. You acquire the skill that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneursâthe ability to switch back and forth in your imagination from your own point of view as writer/painter/seller to the point of view of your reader/gallery-goer/customer. You learn to ask yourself with evÂ­ery sentence and every phrase: Is this interesting? Is it fun or challenging or inventive? Am I giving the reader enough? Is she bored? Is she following where I want to lead her?"<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Wants-Read-Your-Tough-Love/dp/1936891492?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/nobody-wants-to-read-your-sht-summary/<br><br>
Reading Like A Writer<br>Long before there were creative-writing workshops and degrees, how did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries, says Francine Prose.In Reading Like a Writer, Prose invites you to sit by her side and take a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters. She reads the work of the very best writersâDostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, Woolf, Chekhovâand discovers why their work has endured. She takes pleasure in the long and magnificent sentences of Philip Roth and the breathtaking paragraphs of Isaac Babel; she is deeply moved by the brilliant characterization in George Eliot's Middlemarch. She looks to John Le CarrÃ© for a lesson in how to advance plot through dialogue, to Flannery O'Connor for the cunning use of the telling detail, and to James Joyce and Katherine Mansfield for clever examples of how to employ gesture to create character. She cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted.Written with passion, humor, and wisdom, Reading Like a Writer will inspire readers to return to literature with a fresh eye and an eager heart.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23275137M/Reading_like_a_writer<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/reading-like-a-writer-summary/<br><br>
