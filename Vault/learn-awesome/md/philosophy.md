A Force For Good<br>For more than half a century, in such books as The Art of Happiness and The Dalai Lamaâs Little Book of Inner Peace, the Dalai Lama has guided us along the path to compassion and taught us how to improve our inner lives.

Against Empathy<br>New York Post Best Book of 2016We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we donât have enough of it.Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In AGAINST EMPATHY, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion.Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nationsâwho to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and who to imprisonâare too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system; from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, andâyesâultimately more moral.Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, AGAINST EMPATHY shows us that, when it comes to both major policy decisions and the choices we make in our everyday lives, limiting our impulse toward empathy is often the most compassionate choice we can make.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100194-against-empathy<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/against-empathy-summary/<br><br>
As A Man Thinketh<br>2018 Reprint of the 1913 Edition. As a Man Thinketh was first published in 1903. In it, Allen describes how man is the creator and shaper of his destiny by the thoughts which he thinks. We rise and fall in exact accordance with the character of the thoughts which we entertain. Our environment is the result of the thoughts that we harbor and the behavior that our thoughts bring about. Part of the New Thought Movement, Allen reveals the secrets to having the most fulfilling existence possible, guided by a proper understanding and appreciate of how thought shapes our lives. Allen advises on how to better manage our thoughts and how to direct them into more constructive behavior. Though written more than one hundred years ago, the language and resonance of this classic still hold up today, inviting each of us to reflect not on the world and others, but our own thoughts and how to regain their possession. The title for the essay comes from the Bible: "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he," Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7. In more than a century, As A Man Thinketh has become an inspirational classic, selling millions of copies worldwide and bringing faith, inspiration, and self- healing to all who have encountered it.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/As-Man-Thinketh-James-Allen/dp/1684222095?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/as-a-man-thinketh-summary/<br><br>
Breakfast With Socrates<br>
  
 Have breakfast with Socrates, go to work with Nietzsche, head to the gym with Foucault, then have sex with Ovid (or Simone de Beauvoir).   Former Oxford Philosophy Fellow Robert Rowland Smith whisks you through an ordinary day with history's most extraordinary thinkers, explaining what they might have to say about your routine. From waking up in the morning through traveling to work, shopping, eating, going to a party, falling asleep, and dreaming, Smith connects our most mundane habits to the wider world of ideas.  Start with waking up: What does it really mean to be awake? How do we know we're not still dreaming? Descartes argues that if you're able to doubt whether you're awake, you are at least thinking, and so you probably exist -- no small achievement for first thing in the morning. Or take going to the gym: As you toil on the treadmill, is your panting a sign of virtue or of vice, of healthy exertion or of unhealthy narcissism? Working out is a version of what Max Weber called the Protestant work ethic -- a kind of spiritual exercise, it also leads to worldly vanity.  With dry wit and marvelous invention, Smith draws on philosophy, literature, art, politics, and psychology to wake us up to a stunning range of ideas about how to live. Neither breakfast, lunch, nor dinner will ever be the same again.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Breakfast-Socrates-Extraordinary-Philosophical-Ordinary/dp/1439148686?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/breakfast-with-socrates-summary/<br><br>

Meditations On First Philosophy<br>Meditations on First Philosophy is a philosophical treatise written by RenÃ© Descartes first published in Latin in 1641. The book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things which are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. The meditations were written as if he was meditating for 6 days: each meditation refers to the last one as "yesterday". However, Descartes did not take 6 days to complete this work; it actually took several years.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Meditations-First-Philosophy-Hackett-Classics/dp/0872201929?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/meditations-on-first-philosophy-summary/<br><br>
Eating Animals<br>Part memoir and part investigative report, Eating Animals is a groundbreaking moral examination of vegetarianism, farming, and the food we eat every day that inspired the documentary of the same name.Bestselling author Jonathan Safran Foer spent much of his life oscillating between enthusiastic carnivore and occasional vegetarian. For years he was content to live with uncertainty about his own dietary choices-but once he started a family, the moral dimensions of food became increasingly important.Faced with the prospect of being unable to explain why we eat some animals and not others, Foer set out to explore the origins of many eating traditions and the fictions involved with creating them. Traveling to the darkest corners of our dining habits, Foer raises the unspoken question behind every fish we eat, every chicken we fry, and every burger we grill.A must-read for anyone who cares about building a more humane and healthy world, Eating Animals is a book that, in the words of the Los Angeles Times, places Jonathan Safran Foer "at the table with our greatest philosophers."<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-Jonathan-Safran-Foer/dp/0316069884?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/eating-animals-summary/<br><br>

Excellent Sheep<br>A groundbreaking manifesto for people searching for the kind of insight on leading, thinking, and living that elite schools should beâbut arenâtâproviding.As a professor at Yale, Bill Deresiewicz saw something that troubled him deeply. His students, some of the nationâs brightest minds, were adrift when it came to the big questions: how to think critically and creatively, and how to find a sense of purpose.Excellent Sheep takes a sharp look at the high-pressure conveyor belt that begins with parents and counselors who demand perfect grades and culminates in the skewed applications Deresiewicz saw firsthand as a member of Yaleâs admissions committee. As schools shift focus from the humanities to "practical" subjects like economics and computer science, students are losing the ability to think in innovative ways. Deresiewicz explains how college should be a time for self-discovery, when students can establish their own values and measures of success, so they can forge their own path. He addresses parents, students, educators, and anyone who's interested in the direction of American society, featuring quotes from real students and graduates he has corresponded with over the years, candidly exposing where the system is broken and clearly presenting solutions.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26886453M/Excellent_sheep<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/excellent-sheep-summary/<br><br>

The Art Of Travel<br>Any Baedeker will tell us where we ought to travel, but only Alain de Botton will tell us how and why. With the same intelligence and insouciant charm he brought to How Proust Can Save Your Life, de Botton considers the pleasures of anticipation; the allure of the exotic, and the value of noticing everything from a seascape in Barbados to the takeoffs at Heathrow. Even as de Botton takes the reader along on his own peregrinations, he also cites such distinguished fellow-travelers as Baudelaire, Wordsworth, Van Gogh, the biologist Alexander von Humboldt, and the 18th-century eccentric Xavier de Maistre, who catalogued the wonders of his bedroom.

How To Be A Stoic<br>In the tradition of How to Live and How Proust Can Change Your Life, a philosopher asks how ancient Stoicism can help us flourish todayWhenever we worry about what to eat, how to love, or simply how to be happy, we are worrying about how to lead a good life. No goal is more elusive. In How to Be a Stoic, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us--and How to Be a Stoic is the essential guide.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Stoic-Ancient-Philosophy/dp/1541644530?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-to-be-a-stoic-summary/<br><br>

Ikigai - Summary by Derek Sivers<br>Bring meaning and joy to all your days with this internationally bestselling guide to the Japanese concept of ikigai (pronounced ee-key-guy)âthe happiness of always being busyâas revealed by the daily habits of the worldâs longest-living people.Whatâs your ikigai?âOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.â âJapanese proverb According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigaiâa reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the worldâs longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigaiâthe place where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersectâmeans that each day is infused with meaning. Itâs the reason we get up in the morning. Itâs also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact thereâs no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because theyâve found a real purpose in lifeâthe happiness of always being busy. In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-oldsâone of the worldâs Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, andâtheir best-kept secretâhow they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesnât want to find happiness in every day?<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Ikigai<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Ikigai-Japanese-Secret-Long-Happy/dp/0143130722?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/ikigai-summary/<br><br>

Mill is also notable for being the first Member of Parliament to argue in favor of women's suffrage. On Liberty, published in 1859, is generally considered to be Mill's most famous work. Mill applies his ethical system of utilitarianism to society in order to establish a relationship between liberty and authority.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385228.On_Liberty<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/on-liberty-summary/<br><br>

The Antidote<br>Self-help books don't seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealthâeven if you can get itâdoesn't necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can't even agree on what "happiness" means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way?Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it's our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertaintyâthe very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, The Antidote is the intelligent person's guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13721709-the-antidote<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-antidote-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/Antidote<br><br>

The Interpretation Of Dreams<br>What are the most common dreams and why do we have them? What does a dream about death mean? What do dreams of swimming, failing, or flying symbolize?First published by Sigmund Freud in 1899, The Interpretation of Dreams considers why we dream and what it means in the larger picture of our psychological lives. Delving into theories of manifest and latent dream content, the special language of dreams, dreams as wish fulfillments, the significance of childhood experiences, and much more, Freud, widely considered the âfather of psychoanalysis,â thoroughly and thoughtfully examines dream psychology. Encompassing dozens of case histories and detailed analyses of actual dreams, this landmark text presents Freudâs legendary work as a tool for comprehending our sleeping experiences.Renowned for translating Freudâs German writings into English, James Stracheyâwith the assistance of Anna Freudâfirst published this edition in 1953. Incorporating all textual alterations made by Freud over a period of thirty years, it remains the most complete translation of the work in print.Completely redesigned and available for the first time in trade paperback<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24062369M/The_interpretation_of_dreams<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-interpretation-of-dreams-summary/<br><br>

Trying Not To Try<br>A deeply original exploration of the power of spontaneityâan ancient Chinese ideal that cognitive scientists are only now beginning to understandâand why it is so essential to our well-beingÂ  Why is it always hard to fall asleep the night before an important meeting? Or be charming and relaxed on a first date? What is it about a politician who seems wooden or a comedian whose jokes fall flat or an athlete who chokes? In all of these cases, striving seems to backfire.  Â  In Trying Not To Try, Edward Slingerland explains why we find spontaneity so elusive, and shows how early Chinese thought points the way to happier, more authentic lives. Weâve long been told that the way to achieve our goals is through careful reasoning and conscious effort. But recent research suggests that many aspects of a satisfying life, like happiness and spontaneity, are best pursued indirectly. The early Chinese philosophers knew this, and they wrote extensively about an effortless way of being in the world, which they called wu-wei (ooo-way). They believed it was the source of all success in life, and they developed various strategies for getting it and hanging on to it.  Â  With clarity and wit, Slingerland introduces us to these thinkers and the marvelous characters in their texts, from the butcher whose blade glides effortlessly through an ox to the wood carver who sees his sculpture simply emerge from a solid block. Slingerland uncovers a direct line from wu-wei to the Force in Star Wars, explains why wu-wei is more powerful than flow, and tells us what it all means for getting a date. He also shows how new research reveals whatâs happening in the brain when weâre in a state of wu-weiâwhy it makes us happy and effective and trustworthy, and how it might have even made civilization possible.  Â  Through stories of mythical creatures and drunken cart riders, jazz musicians and Japanese motorcycle gangs, Slingerland effortlessly blends Eastern thought and cutting-edge science to show us how we can live more fulfilling lives. Trying Not To Try is mind-expanding and deeply pleasurable, the perfect antidote to our striving modern culture.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Trying-Not-Try-Science-Spontaneity/dp/0770437613?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/trying-not-to-try-summary/<br><br>

Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today.

Why We Work<br>An eye-opening, groundbreaking tour of the purpose of work in our lives, showing how work operates in our culture and how you can find your own path to happiness in the workplace.Why do we work? The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.Weâve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, weâve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through âmenialâ jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.How did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Work-Barry-Schwartz/dp/144237814X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-work-summary/<br><br>
