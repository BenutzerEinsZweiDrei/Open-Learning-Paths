How To Read Literature Like A Professor<br>The classic guide, now available in a hardcover editionâa lively and entertaining introduction to literature and literary basics, including symbols, themes and contexts, that shows you how to make your everyday reading experience more rewarding and enjoyable.While many books can be enjoyed for their basic stories, there are often deeper literary meanings interwoven in these texts. How to Read Literature Like a Professor helps us to discover those hidden truths by looking at literature with the eyesâand the literary codesof the ultimate professional reader, the college professor.What does it mean when a literary hero is traveling along a dusty road? When he hands a drink to his companion? When he's drenched in a sudden rain shower?Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices and form, Thomas C. Foster provides us with a broad overview of literatureâa world where a road leads to a quest, a shared meal may signify a communion, and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just a showerâand shows us how to make our reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.This revised edition includes new chapters, a new preface and epilogue, and incorporates updated teaching points that Foster has developed over the past decade.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/How-Read-Literature-Like-Professor/dp/0062301675?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/how-to-read-literature-like-a-professor-summary/<br><br>
Reading Like A Writer<br>Long before there were creative-writing workshops and degrees, how did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries, says Francine Prose.In Reading Like a Writer, Prose invites you to sit by her side and take a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters. She reads the work of the very best writersâDostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, Woolf, Chekhovâand discovers why their work has endured. She takes pleasure in the long and magnificent sentences of Philip Roth and the breathtaking paragraphs of Isaac Babel; she is deeply moved by the brilliant characterization in George Eliot's Middlemarch. She looks to John Le CarrÃ© for a lesson in how to advance plot through dialogue, to Flannery O'Connor for the cunning use of the telling detail, and to James Joyce and Katherine Mansfield for clever examples of how to employ gesture to create character. She cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted.Written with passion, humor, and wisdom, Reading Like a Writer will inspire readers to return to literature with a fresh eye and an eager heart.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23275137M/Reading_like_a_writer<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/reading-like-a-writer-summary/<br><br>
