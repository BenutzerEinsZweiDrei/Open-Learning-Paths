Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! (2011)<br> This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to try functional programming.

The whole thing is completely free to read online, but it's also available in print and I encourage you to buy as many copies as you can afford!

To contact me, shoot me an email to: bonus at learnyouahaskell dot com! You can also find me idling on #haskell where I go by the name BONUS. <br>book|https://nostarch.com/lyah.htm<br><br>
Write you a Haskell (2014)<br>By Stephen Diehl

In 2014 I wrote a short tutorial about building a small imperative language in Haskell that compiled into LLVM. I was extremely happy with the effect the tutorial seemed to have, and the warm response I got from so many people was very encouraging.

I've done a great bit of thinking about what the most impactful topic I could write about in 2015 could be; and decided throughout this year I will follow up with a large endeavor for another project-based tutorial on building a simple functional programming language from first principles.

This is a nontrivial topic and is unfortunately very much underserved, the knowledge to build such a modern functional language is not widely disseminated among many programmers. The available resources most often discuss language theory in depth while completely glossing over the engineering details. I wished to write a project-based tutorial that included the engineering details and left the reader with a fully functional toy language at the end that could be extended for further projects.

We will build a small functional language called Fun which is a partial Haskell 2010 toy language; complete with a parser, type inference, datatypes, pattern matching, desugaring, typeclasses, higher-kinded types, monadic IO, arbitrary-rank polymorphism, records, Core language, STG intermediate language, lazy evaluation, interpreter, native code generator, a runtime, and several optimization passes.

As with most of my writing, this is the pre-edited rough cut version, which I will refine over time.<br>book|http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/<br><br>

Haskell in Depth (2018)<br>By Vitaly Bragilevsky 

Turn the corner from “Haskell student” to “Haskell developer.” Haskell in Depth explores the important language features and programming skills you’ll need to build production-quality software using Haskell. And along the way, you’ll pick up some interesting insights into why Haskell looks and works the way it does. Get ready to go deep! <br>book|https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth<br><br>
Thinking with Types (2018)<br>By Sandy Maguire

This book aims to be the comprehensive manual for type-level programming. It's about getting you from here to there---from a competent Haskell programmer to one who convinces the compiler to do their work for them.<br>book|https://leanpub.com/thinking-with-types<br><br>
