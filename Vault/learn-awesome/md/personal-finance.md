Dollars and Sense<br>Why is paying for things painful?Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because weâve overpaid for it in the past?Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldnât spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal financeâs most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.Exploring a wide range of everyday topicsâfrom the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the Â pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday salesâAriely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether itâs the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34323010-dollars-and-sense<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/dollars-and-sense-summary/<br><br>
Rule #1<br>Before I became âPhil Town, teacher of investing principles to more than 500,000 people a year,â I was a lot like you: someone who viewed individual stock investing as way too hard to do successfully. As a guy who barely made a living as a river guide, I considered the whole process pretty impenetrable, and I was convinced that to do it right you had to make it a full-time job. Me, I was more interested in having full-time fun.So I was tempted to do what youâre probably doing right now: letting some mutual fund manager worry about growing your nest egg. Let me tell you why that decision could one day make you absolutely miserable. The fact is, because of natural market cycles, the mutual fund industry is likely to soon be facing twenty years of flat returns. That means that if youâve got your nest egg tucked away in fundsâespecially the type found in most 401ksâyour egg wonât get much bigger than it is now. Translation: Get ready for a retirement filled with lots of cold cuts, plenty of quality TV-watching time, and a place to live thatâs too small to accommodate your visiting kids.In this book Iâll show you how I turned $1,000 into $1 million in only five years, and then proceeded to make many millions more. I came to investing as a person who wasnât great at math, possessed zero extra cash, and wanted a lifeânot an extra three hours of work to do every day.Fortunately, I was introduced to The Rule.Rule #1, as famed investor Warren Buffett will tell you, is donât lose money. Through an intriguing process that Iâll clarify in this book, not losing money results in making more money than you ever imagined. What it comes down to is buying shares of companies only when the numbersâand the intangiblesâare on your side. If that sounds too good to be true, itâs because the mind-set Iâll be introducing you to leads not to bets but to certainties. Believe me, if there were anything genius-level about this, Iâd still be a river guide collecting unemployment much of the year.Part of the secret is thinking of yourself as a business owner rather than a stock investor. Part is taking advantage of todayâs new Internet tools, which drastically reduce the âhomework factor.â (Weâre talking a few minutes, tops.) Part is knowing the only five numbers that really count in valuing a potential investment. And partâmaybe the most important partâis using the risk-free Rule #1 approach to consistently pay a mere 50 cents to buy a dollarâs worth of a business.What I wonât waste your time with is fluff: a lot of vague parables reminding you of what you already know and leaving you exactly where you started. This is the real deal, folks: a start-to-finish, one-baby-step-at-a-time approach that will allow you to retire ten years sooner than you planned, with more creature comforts than you ever imagined.Also available as a Random House AudioBook and eBook.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Rule-Strategy-Successful-Investing-Minutes/dp/0307336840?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/rule-1-summary/<br><br>

I Will Teach You To Be Rich - Summary by FourMinuteBooks<br>At last, for a generation that's materially ambitious yet financially clueless comes I Will Teach You To Be Rich, Ramit Sethi's 6-week personal finance program for 20-to-35-year-olds. A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal financeâ banking, saving, budgeting, and investingâand the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship.Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indianâthe conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn't Have to Suck!"; how to get things rollingâfor realâwith only $20; what most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi's website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully ("Your site summarizes everything I want with my lifeâto be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings," --Dan Esparza) and effusively ("Dude, you rock. I love this site!" --Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: "Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in" (San Francisco Chronicle). His writing is smart, his voice is full of attitude, and his ideas are uncommonly sound and refreshingly hype-free.<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/IWillTeachYouToBeRich<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/your-move-summary/<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich/dp/0761147489?tag=learnawesome-20<br><br>

Second Chance<br>Few would argue with the fact that, on many fronts, we are a world in crisis. And there are two sides to every crisis, be it a leadership crisis, an economic crisis, an education crisis or a moral crisis. The two side to crisis are danger and opportunity.Robert Kiyosakiâs new book, Second Chanceâ¦for Your Money and Your Life, uses the lessons from the past and a brutal assessment of the present to prepare readers to seeââand seizeââthe future.If readers can train their minds to see what their eyes cannot, in a world that is becoming increasingly more âinvisibleâ and moving at a high rate of speed, they can have a second chance at creating the life theyâve always wanted.The global problems we face cannot be solved by the same minds and people who created them and todayâs world demands the ability to see the future and prepare for what lies aheadâ¦prepare for the opportunities as well as the challenges.Like it or not, we are all involved in the greatest evolutionary event in human history. The Industrial Age is over and the Information Age continues to accelerate. The visible agents of change have become invisibleâ¦and harder to see. And the future belongs to those who can train their minds, use the past to see the future, and take the steps to create the positive change they want to see in their lives.Second Chance is a guide to understanding how the past will shape the future and how you can use Information Age tools and insights to create a fresh start. This book is a guide to facing head-on the dangers of the crises around usâand steps and tips for seizing the opportunities they present.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27199124M/Second_chance<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/second-chance-summary/<br><br>
Secrets Of The Millionaire Mind<br>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: "Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!" Eker does this by identifying your "money and success blueprint." We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of moneyâand if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and "revise" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen "Wealth Files," which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Secrets-Millionaire-Mind-Mastering-Wealth/dp/0060763280?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/secrets-of-the-millionaire-mind-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/MillionaireMind<br><br>

The Little Book That Still Beats The Market<br>In 2005, Joel Greenblatt published a book that is already considered one of the classics of finance literature. In The Little Book that Beats the Market--a New York Times bestseller with 300,000 copies in print--Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author's time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You'll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone "knows" it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market.As the Wall Street Journal stated about the original edition, "Mr. Greenblatt...says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His 'Little Book' is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there."<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8247775-the-little-book-that-still-beats-the-market<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-little-book-that-still-beats-the-market-summary/<br><br>

The One-Page Financial Plan<br>Whenever I tell people about my job as a financial advisor, the conversation inevitably turns to how hopeless they feel when it comes to dealing with money. More than once, theyâve begged, âJust tell me what to do.âItâs no surprise that even my most successful friends feel confused or paralyzed. Even if they have a shelfful of personal finance books, they donât have time to make sense of all the information available. They donât just want good advice, they want the best adviceâso rather than do the âwrong thing,â they do nothing. Their 401(k) and bank statements pileÂ up, unexamined or maybe even unopened.What they donât realize is that bad calls about money arenât failures; theyâre just what happens when emotional creatures have to make decisions about the future with limited information. What I tell them is that we need to scrap striving for perfection and instead commit to a process of guessing and making adjustments when things go off track. Of course weâre going to make the best guesses we canâbut weâre not going to obsess over getting them exactly right.The fact is, in a single page you can prioritize what you really want in life and figure out how to get there. Thatâs because a great financial plan has nothing to do with what the markets are doing, what your real estate agent is pitching, or the hot stock your brother-in-law told you about. It has everything to do with whatâs most important to you. By now you may be wondering, âWhat about the details? How much do I need to invest each year, and how do I allocate it? How much life insurance do I need?â Donât worry: Iâll cover those topics and many more, sharing strategies that will take the complexity out of them. The most important thing is getting clarity about the big picture so you can cope with the unexpected. Maybe youâll lose the job you thought was secure; youâll take a financial risk that doesnât pan out; youâll have twins when you were only budgeting for one. In other words: Life will happen.But no matter what happens, this book will help you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to go.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571526-the-one-page-financial-plan<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-one-page-financial-plan-summary/<br><br>
The Opposite Of Spoiled<br>In the spirit of Wendy Mogelâs The Blessing of a Skinned Knee and Po Bronson and Ashley Merrymanâs Nurture Shock, New York Times âYour Moneyâ columnist Ron Lieber delivers a taboo-shattering manifesto that explains how talking openly to children about money can help parents raise modest, patient, grounded young adults who are financially wise beyond their years.For Ron Lieber, a personal finance columnist and father, good parenting means talking about money with our kids. Children are hyper-aware of money, and they have scores of questions about its nuances. But when parents shy away from the topic, they lose a tremendous opportunityânot just to model the basic financial behaviors that are increasingly important for young adults but also to imprint lessons about what the family truly values.Written in a warm, accessible voice, grounded in real-world experience and stories from families with a range of incomes, The Opposite of Spoiled is both a practical guidebook and a values-based philosophy. The foundation of the book is a detailed blueprint for the best ways to handle the basics: the tooth fairy, allowance, chores, charity, saving, birthdays, holidays, cell phones, checking accounts, clothing, cars, part-time jobs, and college tuition. It identifies a set of traits and virtues that embody the opposite of spoiled, and shares how to embrace the topic of money to help parents raise kids who are more generous and less materialistic.But The Opposite of Spoiled is also a promise to our kids that we will make them better with money than we are. It is for all of the parents who know that honest conversations about money with their curious children can help them become more patient and prudent, but who donât know how and when to start.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Opposite-Spoiled-Raising-Grounded-Generous/dp/0062247026?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-opposite-of-spoiled-summary/<br><br>

Thou Shall Prosper<br>A practical approach to creating wealth-based on the established principles of ancient Jewish wisdom-made accessible to people of all backgroundsThe ups and downs of the economy prove Rabbi Daniel Lapin's famous principle that the more things change, the more we need to depend upon the things that never change. There's no better source for both practical and spiritual financial wisdom than the time-tested knowledge found in the ancient Jewish faith and its culture.
