Every Noise At Once<br>Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 3,294 genres by Spotify as of 2019-07-29. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.<br>interactive|http://everynoise.com/<br><br>

This Is Your Brain On Music<br>Whether you load your iPod with Bach or Bono, music has a significant role in your lifeâeven if you never realized it. Why does music evoke such powerful moods? The answers are at last be- coming clear, thanks to revolutionary neuroscience and the emerging field of evolutionary psychology. Both a cutting-edge study and a tribute to the beauty of music itself, This Is Your Brain on Music unravels a host of mysteries that affect everything from pop culture to our understanding of human nature, including: â¢ Are our musical preferences shaped in utero? â¢ Is there a cutoff point for acquiring new tastes in music? â¢ What do PET scans and MRIs reveal about the brainâs response to music? â¢ Is musical pleasure different from other kinds of pleasure?This Is Your Brain on Music explores cultures in which singing is considered an essential human function, patients who have a rare disorder that prevents them from making sense of music, and scientists studying why two people may not have the same definition of pitch. At every turn, this provocative work unlocks deep secrets about how nature and nurture forge a uniquely human obsession.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/this-is-your-brain-on-music-summary/<br><br>
