Digital Renaissance<br>How digital technology is upending the traditional creative industries--and why that might be a good thingThe digital revolution poses a mortal threat to the major creative industries--music, publishing, television, and the movies. The ease with which digital files can be copied and distributed has unleashed a wave of piracy with disastrous effects on revenue. Cheap, easy self-publishing is eroding the position of these gatekeepers and guardians of culture. Does this revolution herald the collapse of culture, as some commentators claim? Far from it. In Digital Renaissance, Joel Waldfogel argues that digital technology is enabling a new golden age of popular culture, a veritable digital renaissance.By reducing the costs of production, distribution, and promotion, digital technology is democratizing access to the cultural marketplace. More books, songs, television shows, and movies are being produced than ever before. Nor does this mean a tidal wave of derivative, poorly produced kitsch; analyzing decades of production and sales data, as well as bestseller and best-of lists, Waldfogel finds that the new digital model is just as successful at producing high-quality, successful work as the old industry model, and in many cases more so. The vaunted gatekeeper role of the creative industries proves to have been largely mythical. The high costs of production have stifled creativity in industries that require ever-bigger blockbusters to cover the losses on ever-more-expensive failures.Are we drowning in a tide of cultural silt, or living in a golden age for culture? The answers in Digital Renaissance may surprise you.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39964414-digital-renaissance<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/digital-renaissance-summary/<br><br>

Dollars and Sense<br>Why is paying for things painful?Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because weâve overpaid for it in the past?Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldnât spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In Dollars and Sense, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal financeâs most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.Exploring a wide range of everyday topicsâfrom the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the Â pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday salesâAriely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether itâs the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34323010-dollars-and-sense<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/dollars-and-sense-summary/<br><br>

Smart People Should Build Things<br>Andrew Yang, the founder of Venture for America, offers a unique solution to our countryâs economic and social problemsâour smart people should be building things. Smart People Should Build Things offers a stark picture of the current culture and a revolutionary model that will redirect a generation of ambitious young people to the critical job of innovating and building new businesses.As the Founder and CEO of Venture for America, Andrew Yang places top college graduates in start-ups for two years in emerging U.S. cities to generate job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. He knows firsthand how our current view of education is broken. Many college graduates aspire to finance, consulting, law school, grad school, or medical school out of a vague desire for additional status and progress rather than from a genuine passion or fit.In Smart People Should Build Things, this self-described ârecovering lawyerâ and entrepreneur weaves together a compelling narrative of success stories (including his own), offering observations about the flow of talent in the United States and explanations of why current trends are leading to economic distress and cultural decline. He also presents recommendations for both policy makers and job seekers to make entrepreneurship more realistic and achievable.Â <br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Smart-People-Should-Build-Things/dp/0062292048?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/smart-people-should-build-things-summary/<br><br>
Start-Up Nation<br>START-UP NATION addresses the trillion dollar question: How is it that Israel-- a country of 7.1 million, only 60 years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources-- produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the UK?With the savvy of foreign policy insiders, Senor and Singer examine the lessons of the country's adversity-driven culture, which flattens hierarchy and elevates informality-- all backed up by government policies focused on innovation. In a world where economies as diverse as Ireland, Singapore and Dubai have tried to re-create the "Israel effect", there are entrepreneurial lessons well worth noting. As America reboots its own economy and can-do spirit, there's never been a better time to look at this remarkable and resilient nation for some impressive, surprising clues.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Start-up-Nation-Israels-Economic-Miracle/dp/0446541478?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/start-up-nation-summary/<br><br>
Superfreakonomics<br>The New York Times best-selling Freakonomics was a worldwide sensation, selling over four million copies in thirty-five languages and changing the way we look at the world. Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with SuperFreakonomics, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.Four years in the making, SuperFreakonomics asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or walking drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?SuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?How much good do car seats do?What's the best way to catch a terrorist?Did TV cause a rise in crime?What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?Can eating kangaroo save the planet?Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is â good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.Freakonomics has been imitated many times over â but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23712847M/Superfreakonomics<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/superfreakonomics-summary/<br><br>

The End of Jobs<br>The rapid development of technology and globalization has changed the leverage points in accumulating wealth: money, meaning and freedom.

Who Should Read This Book?   Early Stage Entrepreneurs - Doubting yourself and wondering if you made a smart choice to abandon the traditional career path? In Chapter 5, The Turkey Problem, youâll learn the difference between real and perceived risk and why Entrepreneurship is a smarter choice than ever.  Established Entrepreneurs - Do you have friends, family or team members that donât understand their choices? In chapters 12 through 14 youâll understand how to explain the fundamental drives of your ambition.  Students - Are you considering getting another degree as opposed to starting a business or going to work for an entrepreneurial business? Before you invest hundreds of thousands of dollars, read Chapter 3 to understand why credentials are getting less valuable even as degrees get more expensive.  Corporate Employees - Are you in a position that feels safe but doesnât let you expand your skills and network? In chapter 4 through 6, youâll find out why that job might not be as safe as you think.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27462400M/The_End_of_Jobs<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-end-of-jobs-summary/<br><br>

The House Of Rothschild<br>In his rich and nuanced portrait of the remarkable, elusive Rothschild family, Oxford scholar and bestselling author Niall Ferguson uncovers the secrets behind the family's phenomenal economic success. He reveals for the first time the details of the family's vast political network, which gave it access to and influence over many of the greatest statesmen of the age. And he tells a family saga, tracing the importance of unity and the profound role of Judaism in the lives of a dynasty that rose from the confines of the Frankfurt ghetto and later used its influence to assist oppressed Jews throughout Europe. A definitive work of impeccable scholarship with a thoroughly engaging narrative, 'The House of Rothschild' is a biography of the rarest kind, in which mysterious and fascinating historical figures finally spring to life.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/House-Rothschild-Niall-Ferguson/dp/0140240845?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-house-of-rothschild-summary/<br><br>
The Long Tail<br>We think Chris Anderson is onto something big with 'The Long Tail', a groundbreaking look at a well-known feature of statistical distribution and its potential to revolutionize business. 'Wired' magazine editor Anderson expands his influential 2004 article into a comprehensive exploration of this phenomenon -- which, simply stated, holds that products with low demand or sales volume can collectively comprise a market that exceeds the bestsellers. Catering to the tastes and expectations of consumers increasingly disenchanted with the same old thing, these new "niches" provide limitless opportunity for savvy companies. Fresh, insightful, and surprisingly accessible, 'The Long Tail' explains how to tap into the new economics of abundance.<br>book|https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2467566.The_Long_Tail<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-long-tail-summary/<br><br>

The Upside Of Irrationality<br>The provocative follow-up to the New York Times bestseller Predictably Irrational Why can large bonuses make CEOs less productive?How can confusing directions actually help us?Why is revenge so important to us?Why is there such a big difference between what we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy? In his groundbreaking book Predictably Irrational, social scientist Dan Ariely revealed the multiple biases that lead us into making unwise decisions. Now, in The Upside of Irrationality, he exposes the surprising negative and positive effects irrationality can have on our lives. Focusing on our behaviors at work and in relationships, he offers new insights and eye-opening truths about what really motivates us on the job, how one unwise action can become a long-term habit, how we learn to love the ones we're with, and more. Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational one of the most talked-about bestsellers of the past few years, Ariely uses data from his own original and entertaining experiments to draw arresting conclusions about howÂand whyÂwe behave the way we do. From our office attitudes, to our romantic relationships, to our search for purpose in life, Ariely explains how to break through our negative patterns of thought and behavior to make better decisions. The Upside of Irrationality will change the way we see ourselves at work and at homeÂand cast our irrational behaviors in a more nuanced light.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits-Defying/dp/0061995045?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-upside-of-irrationality-summary/<br>summary|https://sivers.org/book/UpsideOfIrrationality<br><br>
