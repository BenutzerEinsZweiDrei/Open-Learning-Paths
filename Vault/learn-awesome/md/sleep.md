The Sleep Revolution<br>We are in the midst of a sleep deprivation crisis, writes Arianna Huffington, the co-founder and editor in chief of The Huffington Post. And this has profound consequences â on our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness.What is needed, she boldly asserts, is nothing short of a sleep revolution.Â Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives. In her bestsellerÂ Thrive, Arianna wrote aboutÂ our need to redefine success through well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving.Â Her discussion of the importance of sleep as a gateway to this more fulfilling way of livingÂ struck such a powerful chord that she realized theÂ mystery andÂ transformativeÂ power of sleep called for a fuller investigation.The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, fromÂ the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives,Â to the consequences of sleep deprivation, andÂ the newÂ golden age of sleep science that is revealingÂ the vital role sleep plays inÂ our every waking moment andÂ every aspect of our health âÂ fromÂ weight gain,Â diabetes,Â and heart disease to cancerÂ and Alzheimerâs.InÂ The Sleep Revolution, Arianna shows how our cultural dismissal of sleep as time wasted compromises our health and our decision-making and undermines our work lives,Â our personal lives --Â and even our sex lives.Â She explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream.Â She takes on the dangerous sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power.In today's fast-paced, always-connected,Â perpetually-harriedÂ and sleep-deprived world, our need for a good nightâs sleep is more important â and elusive -- than ever. The Sleep RevolutionÂ both sounds the alarm on our worldwide sleep crisis and provides a detailed road map to the great sleep awakening that can help transform our lives, our communities, and our world.<br>book|https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Revolution-Transforming-Your-Night/dp/110190402X?tag=learnawesome-20<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-sleep-revolution-summary/<br><br>
