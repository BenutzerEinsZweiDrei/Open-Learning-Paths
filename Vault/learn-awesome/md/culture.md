I Wear The Black Hat<br>From New York Times bestselling author, âone of Americaâs top cultural criticsâ (Entertainment Weekly), and âThe Ethicistâ for The New York Times Magazine, comes a new book of all original pieces on villains and villainy in popular culture.Chuck Klosterman has walked into the darkness. As a child, he rooted for conventionally good characters like wide-eyed Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. But as Klosterman aged, his alliances shiftedâfirst to Han Solo and then to Darth Vader. Vader was a hero who consciously embraced evil; Vader wanted to be bad. But what, exactly, was that supposed to mean? When we classify someone as a bad person, what are we really saying (and why are we so obsessed with saying it)? In I Wear the Black Hat, Klosterman questions the very nature of how modern people understand the culture of villainy. What was so Machiavellian about Machiavelli? Why donât we see Batman the same way we see Bernhard Goetz? Whoâs more worthy of our vitriolâBill Clinton or Don Henley? What was O.J. Simpsonâs second-worst decision? And why is Klosterman still obsessed with some kid he knew for one week in 1985?Masterfully blending cultural analysis with self-interrogation and limitless imagination, I Wear the Black Hat delivers perceptive observations on the complexity of the anti-hero (seemingly the only kind of hero America still creates). I Wear the Black Hat is the rare example of serious criticism thatâs instantly accessible and really, really funny. Klosterman is the only writer doing whatever it is heâs doing.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Wear-Black-Hat-Grappling-Villains/dp/143918450X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/i-wear-the-black-hat-summary/<br><br>

The World According To Star Wars<br>Thereâs Santa Claus, Shakespeare, Mickey Mouse, the Bible, and then thereâs Star Wars. Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williamsâs score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the filmsâ wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time.<br>book|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27210269M/The_world_according_to_Star_Wars<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/the-world-according-to-star-wars-summary/<br><br>
Why We Work<br>An eye-opening, groundbreaking tour of the purpose of work in our lives, showing how work operates in our culture and how you can find your own path to happiness in the workplace.Why do we work? The question seems so simple. But Professor Barry Schwartz proves that the answer is surprising, complex, and urgent.Weâve long been taught that the reason we work is primarily for a paycheck. In fact, weâve shaped much of the infrastructure of our society to accommodate this belief. Then why are so many people dissatisfied with their work, despite healthy compensation? And why do so many people find immense fulfillment and satisfaction through âmenialâ jobs? Schwartz explores why so many believe that the goal for working should be to earn money, how we arrived to believe that paying workers more leads to better work, and why this has made our society confused, unhappy, and has established a dangerously misguided system.Through fascinating studies and compelling anecdotes, this book dispels this myth. Schwartz takes us through hospitals and hair salons, auto plants and boardrooms, showing workers in all walks of life, showcasing the trends and patterns that lead to happiness in the workplace. Ultimately, Schwartz proves that the root of what drives us to do good work can rarely be incentivized, and that the cause of bad work is often an attempt to do just that.How did we get to this tangled place? How do we change the way we work? With great insight and wisdom, Schwartz shows us how to take our first steps toward understanding, and empowering us all to find great work.<br>book|https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Work-Barry-Schwartz/dp/144237814X?tag=learnawesome-21<br>summary|https://fourminutebooks.com/why-we-work-summary/<br><br>
